# Label your solutions
* Please make sure solutions are labeled with your name/initials, the date that you made them
* Please do not use stock solutions for molecular work - pour out solutions into aliquots in falcon tubes or glass jars
* Please make sure your aliquots are labeled with the stock solution, the date they were made, who made them, and your name on the aliquot
* Do not share aliquots with other people in the lab

### 1mM EDTA (pH - 8) for storing extracted RNA 

EDTA should help stabilize and protect the RNA, but be sure to check with downstream library prep first. Use sterile 25mL pipettes to measure RNA free water and put into a 100mL glassware (autoclaved, wiped clean with RNAaseZap or RNAase Away, and rinsed with RNAase-free water). Clean magnetic spinbar with RNAaseZap. Calibrate pH meter and wipe outside with RNAase zap. Use pasteur pipette to add HCl for pH adjustment, but wipe outside with RNAase-Zap.

|------------|--------|
|Disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate (Fisher #BP120500) | 0.372 g |
|Water | 80ml|
|NaOH (Fisher #BP359-212) |0.036 g|

* Stir vigorously on a magnetic stirrer. Adjust the pH to 8.0. Sterilize by autoclaving

| Ingredient | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| Ethidium bromide (Fisher #BP1025) | 1g |
| Water | 100ml |

* stir on magnetic stirrer for several hours to ensure that the dye has dissolved 
* light sensitive, wrap the container in aluminum foil or transfer to a dark bottle 
* store at 4C



### CTAB

|------------|--------|
| 4M NaCl (Fisher #S271-1)| 35 mL|
| 0.5M EDTA pH 8.0 (Fisher #BP120500)| 4 mL |
| 1M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 | 10 mL |
| CTAB (Cetyl Trimethyl-Ammonium Bromide) (Fisher #AC22716100) | 2g |

* Mix ingredients together in a clean beaker. Stir on hot plate with stir bar. Heat gently until CTAB is dissolved. Pour into graduated cylinder and bring volume up to 100ml using nanopure H2O. Pour into a bottle with a cap. Autoclave before using. Store at room temperature. Discard after 1 year.

### TE 

A low TE buffer that is 0.1mM EDTA is better for DNA that is destined for next-generation sequencing, because the EDTA interferes with enzymatic reactions.

| Ingredient | Amount |
|------------|--------|
|Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) X M | ? |
|EDTA (pH 8.0) X mM | ? |

* Start with a small volume of nanopure H20, about half of your final volume, in a beaker with a stirbar.
* Measure out the amount of Tris-Hcl needed for a 10mM solution
* Add to H20
* Measure out the amount of EDTA needed for a 1mM solution
* Add to H20 and Tris
* While stirring solution, carefully insert calibrated pH probe
* Adjust pH as needed with either HCl or NaOH
* Note: EDTA will not fully dissolve until pH is near 8.0 and will cause pH to fluctuate as it dissolves, so be prepared to make many small adjustments in either direction ( it is best to work with diluted acids and bases).
* Also: if you overshoot 8.0, it is okay to readjust in the other direction (even if you wildly overshoot the mark) and you DO NOT need to throw the solution out and start again

* After pH is adjusted, transfer solution to graduated cylinder and add H20 to bring to final concentration.
* Some people think TE buffer should not be autoclaved, but I usually autoclave it. Tris breaks down easily after autoclaving and will precipitate out more easily, so you may have to make the solution up more frequently. In my opinion, that is better than chancing a solution with DNAse.
* Store at room temperature and discard if sediment is forming on the bottom of the container or if it starts growing or if it gets cloudy.
* For 100ml: 1M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) 1ml and 0.5M EDTA (pH 8.0) 200ul
* Bring to a final volume of 100ml with nanopure H20

|------------|--------|
| Tris base (Fisher #BP15210) | 60.56g |
| ddH20 | 400ml |

* Adjust pH to 8.0 using HCL and bring final volume to 500ml
