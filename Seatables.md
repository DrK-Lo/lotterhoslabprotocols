# Managing Seatables
If you are using the seatables, please follow our daily checklist.

(Add daily checklist here).

# Influent treatment

## Unfiltered Seawater

## Filtered Seawater


# Effluent treatment

Daily checklist:

* Check to make sure the float valve is working. It should turn on when it is lifted up, and turn off when it falls down. 
If it accidently gets moved, the float valve may not fall all the way down and will not turn off, BURNING OUT THE PUMP.

Weekly:

* Clean the sump in a bucket of freshwater. First, lift up the float valve and drain most of the salt water from the sump tank down to normal stop level.
Fill a "E" bucket (be careful, some buckets have had chemicals and not for placement in sump) with freshwater. 
Unplug the sump pump, and carefully place it in the bucket. Plug it back in, and use the float valve to turn it on and hold it up 
until the pump runs through the bucket of freshwater. Then unplug the pump again, place it back in the tank, and plug it in.
Test the float valve again as described in "Effluent: Daily checklist".

Monthly:

* Use the shop vac to clean out the debris at the bottom of the sump.

## Treated effluent

* Please treat effluent for any animals not collected from Nahant. 
* Make sure that the valve to the filters is open and the other valve is closed.
* Make sure that both UV lights are turned ON.

Daily checklist:

* On Slack, post pressure on the pressure gauge before the mechanical filter and the gauge after the mechanical filter. 
If this pressure differential exceeds 5psi when the pump is running, we need to check the filter.

  * Changing the filter in the blue housing. Turn off the flow to the seatables, unplug the pump and UV lights. Close the valves. 
  Open the housing and remove the filter. There is a replacement filter behind the blue housing. 
  Grease the O-ring on the housing with silicon grease and change the filter. 
  Set all the valves correctly, plug everything back in and turn everything back on. 
  Check to make sure float valve is working, check for leaks in pipes and around filter housing.

  * Changing the UV lights (TO DO).
  
## Untreated effluent

* Make sure that the valve to the filters is closed and the other valve is open. Make sure the UV lights are unplugged.
