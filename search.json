    "text": "If you are using the seatables, please follow the following:\n\n\nLink to Daily Checklist Table\n\nMake sure freshwater is turned off at the end of the day. (This is a high pressure line and would flood the bunker if burst).\nCheck to make sure any heat sources in the tables are on top of silicone pads.\nCheck all plugs are working and the appropriate plugs are on emergency backup (red).\nMake sure anything that could scratch the tables (oyster shells, ceiling tile) are on silicone pads.\nInfluent - check flow rate and position of all hoses. Pressure fluctuates with MSC-wide system use from day to day. Check that hoses are secure at the base.\nEffluent float valve - Make sure the float valve is working. It should turn on when it is lifted up, and turn off when it falls down. If the float valve does not turn on, the sump tank will overflow and flood the bunker. If the float valve does not fall all the way down it will not turn off, which will burn out the pump. If the sump pump burns out, the sump tank will overflow and flood the bunker.\nEffluent UV lights - If effluent is being treated, check that both the UV lights are working and the water is flowing in the correct direction.\nSea Table Drains - Make sure drains are clear of debris.\nEffluent - write down the pressure on the valve before the blue filter and the valve after the blue filter.\nInfluent filtered water - write down the pressure on the valve before and after the filters on the incoming water.\nHousekeeping - Make sure all lines are labeled (e.g. unfiltered seawater, filtered seawater, municipal freshwater, etc.), all lab equipment is labeled “Lotterhos”, and all equipment and tools are put out of sight (things tend to walk off).\nCheck for dead animals.\n\n\n\n\nLink to Weekly Checklist Table\n\nEffluent - Clean the sump in a bucket of freshwater. First, lift up the float valve and drain most of the salt water from the sump tank down to normal stop level. Fill a “E” bucket (be careful, some buckets have had chemicals and not for placement in sump) with freshwater. Unplug the sump pump, and carefully place it in the bucket. Plug it back in, and use the float valve to turn it on and hold it up until the pump runs through the bucket of freshwater. Then unplug the pump again, place it back in the tank, and plug it in. Test the float valve again as described in “Daily checklist: Effluent float valve.”\nEffluent - inspect sump pump hose for cracks, especially around where the hose clamps are. Make sure the hose clamps are tight.\n\n\n\n\nLink to Monthly Table\n\nUse the shop vac to clean out the debris at the bottom of the sump.\nCheck for leaks along the main lines to the sea tables.\nCheck for leaks along the the freshwater line.\nCheck for leaks along the bottom pipe that runs below the sea tables to the sump pump\nCheck for leaks when the sump pump is running between the sump and the drainage pipe.\nAll motors (fans, pumps, etc), solenoids, and relays are inductive in nature. Do not plug these into power strips, plug them directly into the red receptacles. Check monthly.\nCheck the plugs for corrosion. Scrub with green abrasive pad.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfiltered seawater has a central connection to a PVC pipe that runs across all the tables.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltered seawater is connected on the left side of the tables and currently only runs to the first table.\n\n\n\n\n\nTO DO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee MSC Best Practices Document. Usually we treat effluent for any animals not collected from Nahant or the Massachusetts Bay area.\nMake sure that the valve to the filters is open and the other valve is closed.\nMake sure that both UV lights are turned ON.\n\n\n\n\nChanging the filter in the blue housing. Turn off the flow to the seatables, unplug the pump and UV lights. Close the valves. Open the housing and remove the filter. There is a replacement filter behind the blue housing. Grease the O-ring on the housing with silicon grease and change the filter. Set all the valves correctly, plug everything back in and turn everything back on. Check to make sure float valve is working, check for leaks in pipes and around filter housing.\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that the valve to the filters is closed and the other valve is open.\nMake sure the UV lights are unplugged.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the instructions!\n \n\n\nIf you see water in the quartz sleeve, this means it was not put together correctly and it leaked.\n\nAlso look for signs that the bulb is burning out by the black residue inside the quartz tube:\n\nIf the light is blue does that mean the UV light is working? Read the instructions to find the answer to this question. The answer will surprise you.\n\n\n\nMake sure when you change the bulb, to follow the instructions and use silicone grease. It can be found in a plastic box with a white top labeled “hot glue, silicone grease, etc.”\n\nOn the gasket (which should be changed once a year), make sure to put some silicone grease on the inside and smoosh it around with your finger:\n\nMake sure to follow these instructions as you put it back together:\n\nThis is wrong:\n\nMake sure when you put it back together, screw in the coupling tight before attaching it to the housing:\n\nIt’s hard to see, but check that the gasket is securely in place:\n\nWhen you put the wires in, make sure not to let them get twisted by carefully stuffing them inside,\n\nthen holding the top wire taught (don’t let it twist) while you screw the top on:\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace bulbs. If the light is blue does that mean the UV light is working? Read the instructions to find the answer to this question. The answer will surprise you.\nReplace gasket.

    "text": "Here is a presentation from Research Computing on terminology and optimizing workflows in the lab: Optimization_Lotterhos_labmeeting_Sekar-V2.pdf\nTo view your recent jobs, use acct -S 2020-08-01 -u lotterhos will list all jobs since that date for user lotterhos\nTo learn about how much memory a job used, type seff jobID - will give memory for the job that was requested and how much was used.\nCheck job efficiency and performance:\na. R code in part c from Workflow parralelization approaches shows an example of how you can capture the run time of a particular job, or a parallel segment by printing out the time difference it takes to calculate a particular part. You can also modify this to calculate the total time it took to run your code. To find the best performance, I would recommend to benchmark the calculations on (for example) 1,24,8,16,32 cores and see if at some point it levels off in terms of run time, this may mean that there would be no benefit to request more cores beyond that. Research Computing can discuss performance testing, just schedule another consultation time.\nb. You can also look at the efficiency and memory usage of your jobs by looking at the completed jobs from your slurm history, by typing: acct -S 2020-08-10 -u albecker Then, selecting a particular job (might be beneficial to have a small script that runs through all jobs, since you had over 100,000 jobs this month, I can help with that too if needed) and using the seff command to extract the efficiency. For example:\n$ seff 13291706\nJob ID: 13291706\nCluster: discovery\nUser/Group: albecker/users\nState: COMPLETED (exit code 0)\nCores: 1\nCPU Utilized: 00:01:58\nCPU Efficiency: 99.16% of 00:01:59 core-walltime\nJob Wall-clock time: 00:01:59\nMemory Utilized: 284.50 MB\nMemory Efficiency: 0.56% of 50.00 GB\nHere, you can see that the CPU efficiency was very high at 99%, but you ended up using less than 1% of the memory you requested (284.50 MB out of 50.00 GB). This information is useful to better allocate and utilize resources in the future.\nc. It is also recommended to perform short testing prior to submit long jobs to the cluster. You can use the “debug”, “express” or the “lotterhos” partition and you can run the job interactively. For example, this will give you resources on the debug partition (up to 20 minutes). srun -p debug --nodes=1 --ntasks=16 --pty /bin/bash\n\n\nFor example, the lotterhos partition runs a lot faster than the short partition\nIf you optimize on the lotterhos partition, then your jobs will run out of time on the short partition\n\n\n\nHere is an example header for an array script:\n#SBATCH --job-name=SlimRun\n#SBATCH --mail-user=k.lotterhos@northeastern.edu\n#SBATCH --mail-type=FAIL\n#SBATCH --partition=lotterhos\n#SBATCH --mem=4G\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --CPUs-per-task=2\n#SBATCH --array=50-151%70\n#SBATCH --output=/work/lotterhos/MVP-NonClinalAF/slurm_log/SlimRun20210826_%j.out\n#SBATCH --error=/work/lotterhos/MVP-NonClinalAF/slurm_log/SlimRun20210826_%j.err\n\nsource ~/miniconda3/bin/activate MVP_env\nThe Lotterhos partition has 72 Cores, divided across two nodes. First, you need to know more about the how the programs that your script will call work. Can thay utilize multiple cores (threads)? Or do they only use one core?\nThis is an example header from a submission script for an array that reads in rows 50-150 from a file that has the parameters that I want to run.\nAnd explanation of the following terms:\n#SBATCH --array=50-151%70\n\nThis will run 101 array tasks, for parameters 50-151 in the filename, and submit 70 jobs at a time.\nIf each task in array requires 1 CPU, you could also run up to 72 jobs at at time with 50-151%72, to maximize the resources in the lotterhos partition. But, it is good to leave a couple of cores open for srun tasks.\nIf each task requires 2 CPUS, set --CPUs-per-task=2 (look it up) and set --array=50-151%36 to maximize the resources in the lotterhos partition.\nIF programs can use multiple threads, do benchmarking to determine CPU per task, 1-2 jobs at a time, and do seff on those tasks that completed (see below). Test 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 CPUs. Then set that in the line.\n\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n\nSet this to 1 unless we know the program can communicate between the nodes.\nIf you set this to 1 and you set 50-151%72, it will use both nodes on lotterhos, but only one CPU per node. If you set #SBATCH --nodes=2 and --array=50-151%72, it will only submit up to 36 jobs at a time because it will set aside 1 CPU from each node, and only one CPU will be used while the other one will remain idle if the program does not communicate between the nodes.\n\n#SBATCH --mem=4GB\n\nThis is the amount of memory needed for each task.\nIf I set #SBATCH --array=50-151%70, and each task needs 3GB memory (see below), it’s best to add a add buffer in case one task requires more memory.\nIf your submission script doesn’t specify anthing, it will use the default amount which I would have to look up. For some array tasks, the default might work well, but it might not work well every time. The default memory is limited, so it’s always recommended to set it higher so you don’t run out.\n\n\n\nseff 20714872\nJob ID: 20714872\nArray Job ID: 20714872_151\nCluster: discovery\nUser/Group: lotterhos/users\nState: COMPLETED (exit code 0)\nNodes: 2\nCores per node: 1\nCPU Utilized: 00:13:00\nCPU Efficiency: 48.51% of 00:26:48 core-walltime\nJob Wall-clock time: 00:13:24\nMemory Utilized: 768.23 MB\nMemory Efficiency: 19.21% of 3.91 GB\nThis report is for the specified array task (in this case index 151 in the array)\nThis array task required 0.1921 x 3.91 ~ 0.75 GB memory.\nThis task used 2 cores (1 from each node), but the actual programs being used didn’t commuicate between the nodes. So it was not a well formatted array.\nIt only used half of the CPU, but the array will run each task on an individual CPU. So there is not much we can do about that."

Sharps containers are typically not labelled with the Haz Waste Label. NEVER leave razor blades on the benches\n\n\n\nOur liquid waste typically consists of extraction/library prep isolation and wash solutions, preservative solutions, such as ethanol and formalin, and plastic-glassware cleaning solutions, such as HCl.\nLiquid waste should NEVER be mixed indiscriminately - this can cause serios issues such as thermal reactions/explosions and production of harmful fumes.\nTherefore, keep one waste bottle for each type of waste solution you are generating.\nIf you know your work will be generating liquid waste, label each waste bottle BEFORE you start, using the standard Hazardous Waste Label\n\nManaging open stream waste containers:\n\nlabel the waste containers: fill out all fields EXCEPT the “date container filled” - to keep an open stream bottle (meaning you still expect to produce more of that same waste in the upcoming days/weeks), leave the ‘date container filled’ field empty;\nkeep all waste containers in their secondary containment (gray trays) and in the satelitte accumulation areas in our lab as much as possible\nmake sure that tops are closed tightly once you are done using the waste bottle.\n\nHaz waste disposal: once a waste bottle is at maximum waste volume (3/4 of the total volume) or you are done generating that particular waste\n\ndate the bottle (“date container filled”)\nimmediately schedule pickup:\n\non BioRAFT: Lotterhos Lab > Waste > Submit New Waste Pickup Request\nemail Ryan with number and location of items to be picked up.\n\n\n\nNote: Once the label has been dated, pickup request must be submitted within 3 days; to be sure it gets done, we recommend that pickup is scheduled immediately (or at leaste before the end of the day). Because we are not on the main campus, Ryan Hill (MSC facilities) does all of our waste pickup so you must email him to ask him to come to the lab for that specific purpose; don’t hesitate to follow up if he hasn’t responded or you see that waste has not been collected within a day or 2. For liquid waste, let him know specifically which containers to pickup (for example, put all containers to be picke up in a separate tray inside the Satelite Accumulation Area and leave a note on the tray saying - “please pickup all 3 bottles inside this tray”). For mayo jars or sharps container, I usually place them on the bench right across from the lab door, inside a cardboard box if possible, with a note as well."

Katie’s laptop from home: sign into NU VPN, make sure Globus Connect Personal App is running, plug in ethernet cord\nBecause accessing this server is done through a computer, it makes transferring files specific to the computer that the server is mapped to.

Then you should be able to map to the server.\n\nStep 1: In the Globus Desktop App, then go to Preferences-> Access and click the “+” sign. On a Mac, at the top center click on the bar, click on the name of the computer, and you should see the mapped server there as a volume Volumes/lotterhos. Click on it and add it to the list.\n\nStep 2: In the Globus Web App, go to the endpoint for the computer. Then type Volumes/lotterhos/ in the path. Save it as a bookmark.\nStep 3: Before you can conduct file transfers from a personal endpoint, you need to have a “Globus Plus Account”. Email James Macalino at NU research computing to get added. You will then receive an email."

    "text": "The protocol for collecting samples for RNA extraction\n\n\n\nWith next generation sequencing, it is important to consider all sources of possible contamination when collecting samples. It is also important to consider the study question. For example, best results for RNA extraction will come from flash-frozen tissue or tissue stored in RNA-later. It is important to consider the source tissue (because of tissue-specific expression) when designing an experiment with RNA.\nA good resource is the RNA-seqlopedia and our RNA-seq page.\n\nRNAases will “eat” DNA and they are everywhere. Use a sterilized surface. Sterilize surface with 10% bleach or UV light, then use RNAase Away to clean the surface.\nRNA degrades in as little as 30 seconds, so tissues should be harvested quickly.\nUse sterile blades and switch the blade between samples.\nAll centrifuge tubes used to store tissues should be sterilized and prepared before going out. In general, it is best practice to have tubes organized in a box, with at least 2 labels on each tube (in case one falls off). We have a special barcode label printer (with freezer-proof labels) that can be used.\n\n\n\n\n\nScalpels with replaceable, sterile blades\nAutoclaved glass pyrex dish for cutting sample on and a flame to torch it; alternatively can use weigh boats that are RNAase/DNAase free\nAutoclaved tweezers, probes, etc. Ideally use tweezers without the ridges, between which tissue gets stuck.\nEthanol in an autoclaved beaker for rinsing dissecting tools\nA small flame for sterilizing dissecting tools between samples\nPrepared, Autoclaved and labeled (with EtOH-proof pen) microcentrifuge tube(s)\nRNA-ase away to wipe off surfaces and blades between samples\nNitex gloves\n\n\n\n\nWe use Fisher cryovials (#10-500-26), although note that they are really not designed to put into liquid N2. They work well for short-term storage in liquid N2 and then transfer to the -80C.\n\n\n\nWe have successfully placed tissue in RNAlater and flash frozen, with good results for RNA extraction.\nIf the tissue cannot be flash frozen in RNAlater, than it is important to:\n(1) Get the tissue:RNAlater ratio correct following manufacturer’s directions: Trim the tissue to be less than 0.5 cm in at least one dimension and simply submerge it in 5 volumes of RNAlater solution (e.g., a 0.5 g sample requires about 2.5 mL of RNAlater solution).\n(2) Keep the tissue at the correct temperature following the manufacturer’s direction for the specified amount of time before transferring to -80C. This allows the RNAlater to permeate the tissues. Do not freeze samples in RNAlater® Solution immediately; READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. Typically we store at 4°C overnight (to allow the solution to thoroughly penetrate the tissue), remove supernatant, then move to –20°C or –80°C for long-term storage. Although, we have had good luck flash-freezing tissues in RNAlater.\nSamples can be stored in RNAlater at 4°C for one month, at 25°C for one week, or at –20°C indefinitely. Archive tissues treated with RNAlater solution at –20°C.\n\nIf any precipitation of RNAlater® Solution is seen, heat it to 37°C and agitate to redissolve it.\nIf the crystals do not go into solution at 37°C, loosen the cap and heat the solution at a higher temperature, up to 65°C, for ~30 minutes, mixing periodically. Once the crystals have dissolved, store the solution in smaller aliquots in case crystals re-form after cooling. Warming the solution in this way does not affect performance of RNAlater Solution."

    "text": "Edit this page\n\n\n\nThe qPCR machine is located in the Bowen Lab. Please coordinate with their lab before using the machine. This protocol is used to quantify the amount of each of your libraries that will be sequenced by the sequencer. Quantifying by other means will tell you how much dsDNA you have in your library, but the qPCR will tell you how much library was successfully amplified and how much will be read by the sequencer. You should run each sample in triplicate on the qPCR to minimize error in these measurements especially when pooling samples for sequencing.\n\n\n\n\nKit: KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Universal) (Cat #: KK4923)\nSpecific strip tubes & caps: Agilent AriaMx 96 Tube Strips (Cat #: ) & Agilent Optical Cap, 8x Strip (Cat #: )\nMake a stock of 10 mM Tris-HCl + 0.05% Tween-20 (optional but recommended for the dilution of library DNA, as it leads to improved accuracy by reducing the adherence of DNA to plastic surfaces)\nCopy of KAPA Protocol Found here\nEnsure qPCR reagents are thawed and properly mixed. If the kit is new, the 2X KAPA SYBR-FAST qPCR Master Mix (5mL) should be combined with 1 mL 10X Illumina Primer Premix and then aliquoted out. These should be labeled with the date it was mixed because once mixed the reagent is only good for (60 days double check that timeframe).\n1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube per library\nPreviously quantified libraries and their concentrations\nTurn on qPCR machine (needs some time to warm up so turn on before you start setting up your reactions)\n\n\n\n\n\nLibraries need to be diluted to be read on the QPCR machine. All dilutions should be done in 10 mM Tris-HCl + 0.05% Tween-20. First dilute sample to a 1:1000 concentration in a 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube (Table 1).\n\n\n\n| Reagent | Amount | |———————————|———| | 10 mM Tris-HCl + 0.05% Tween-20 | 999 uL | | Library dsDNA | 1 uL | | Total | 1000 uL |\n\nNext dilute your sample libraries to ensure they fall within the range of the standards provided by the KAPA kit (Table 2). Typically for a library in the range of 1-200 ng/uL you need a 1:18000 dilution to be read on the QPCR machine. However, you can use the calculation below to determine what you need to dilute your undiluted library down to:\n\n\n\n\n\nCalc 1: (Undiluted Library Conc. (ng/uL)/ (617.9 g/mol * fragment size of library)) * 10^6 = undiluted library in nM\nCalc 2: undiluted library in nM * 1000 = undiluted library in pM\nCalc 3: dilute final library to be in the range of the standards in Table 2\n\n\n\n\n| Standard Name | dsDNA concentration (pM) | |—————|————————–| | Standard 1 | 20 | | Standard 2 | 2 | | Standard 3 | 0.2 | | Standard 4 | 0.02 | | Standard 5 | 0.002 | | Standard 6 | 0.0002 |\n\n\n\n\n\nqPCR reactions for the six standards and each library dilution should be set up in triplicate. Load each well of the qPCR strip tubes as indicated below in Table 3, for a total reaction volume of 20 uL. Below is an example set up when running 8 libraries in triplicate (Table 4).\nNote: you can not label the individual tubes. Make sure you pay attention to your strip tube orientation and order. Tip: Always put the “A” side of strip tude on top and label each strip tube tap with the numbers 1 - # of strip tubes. Have a key in your notebook to what each of those strips contain. When you are doing a lot of these it is easy to mix up what was in what tube.\nNote: mix contents of each reaction very well by pipetting up and down ~20 times.\n\n\n\n| Reagent | Amount | |—————————————————|——–| | KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix containing Primers | 12 uL | | PCR-grade water | 4 uL | | Diluted dsDNA library dsDNA Standard (1-6) | 4 uL | | Total | 20 uL |\n\n\n\n| | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | |—|——|——|——|——-|——-|——-| | A | Std1 | Std1 | Std1 | Samp1 | Samp1 | Samp1 | | B | Std2 | Std2 | Std2 | Samp2 | Samp2 | Samp2 | | C | Std3 | Std3 | Std3 | Samp3 | Samp3 | Samp3 | | D | Std4 | Std4 | Std4 | Samp4 | Samp4 | Samp4 | | E | Std5 | Std5 | Std5 | Samp5 | Samp5 | Samp5 | | F | Std6 | Std6 | Std6 | Samp6 | Samp6 | Samp6 | | G | Blk | Blk | Blk | Samp7 | Samp7 | Samp7 | | H | | | | Samp8 | Samp8 | Samp8 |\n\nEnsure that the qPCR plate is sealed.\nCollect all components in the bottom of the well by brief centrifucation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake final reaction strip tubes to the Bowen lab for use on the qPCR machine.\nTurn on the power button in the bottom left hand corner. This will take a few minutes because the machine runs self diagnostics when booting up.\nOn the home screen, click “Quantitative PCR Fluoresence Probe”\n\n\n\nThe first screen that will pop up is your plate set up. Here click the top left corner of the plate to select all wells and in the bottom right corner change the dye from “FAM” to “SYBR”. This updates all wells to have the correct dye information for your run.\n\n\n\nNext for each well make sure to label as either a “Standard” well, “NTC” (no template control) well, or “Unknown” well. For example, to do this for standards, highlight all cells that are locations of standards and move to the top right corner dropdown menu called “Well Types” and set it to standard. You can click and drag to highlight multiple locations in a row or just click on all the cells individually. You can always deselect by clicking that cell again or deselect everything using the top left corner square.\n\n\n\nNext click on the left tab that says “Thermal Profile” and set the specifications for your run (Table 5). You do this by clicking any value (e.g., time or temperature) and manually editing the values as shown in the image below.\n\n\n\n\n| Step | Temperature | Time | Cycles | |————————————–|————-|——–|——–| | Initial activation/denaturation | 95C | 5 min | 1 | | Denaturation | 95C | 30 sec | 35 | | Annealing/extension/data acquisition | 60C | 45 sec | * |\nThe denature and annealing steps are both run together for 35 cycles. Markdown tables are frustrating and you can’t merge cells of a table. See the image at the bottom of this section for clarification. Once the specifications are set properly, place the tubes in the qPCR machine and click “Run Experiment”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo analyze the output you have to use the AriaMx program located on the Bowen laptop that is typically plugged into the tapestation in the Shared Molecular Space.\nFirst use the red flash drive (pictured below) to get your data off of the qPCR machine. Only this flash drive works (not sure why?).\n\n\n\nThen shut down the qPCR machine and take the flash drive to the tapestation computer. Here you should open the Agilent Aria program to see your data.\n\n\n\nOnce the program opens a similar table to what you saw on the qPCR machine will open. Standard cells will be a redish pink color, sample cells blue and no template control green. For the standard cells you need to manually enter each value into the program. This is done by highlighting one cell and moving to the properties tab on the right side panel. Then in the standard quantities section place the value of that standard in the “Amount” field and change the Units field to picograms. These values will correspond to the order you put your ladder in and are the values in Table 2. Double check all inputs once you complete all your standard wells then you are ready to view your results.\n\n\n\nHighlight all cells then move to the “Graphical Displays” to inspect your amplification plots and where your samples fall on your standard curve. You can do a visual inspection here to ensure your samples fall within your standards, but you need to export your Cq values to determine actually concentrations of your samples.\n\n\n\nTo export your Cq values make sure all samples are highlighted in the right hand column. Right click and select “export to excel”. Save your excel file to a hard drive and take it to your personal computer."

    "text": "Edit this page\n\nThe average time it takes to publish a paper after you first submit it for review is 6-9 months. Each round of review takes 1-4 months, each round of revisions take 1-2 months, and then it can take a month or more to get the proofs and approve the final version for publication. Plan accordingly. If I want a paper published in a particular calendar year, I try to get it submitted by March.\nRead this great ariticle with tips from a famous fiction author on how to write a great paper\n\n\nWriting has two facets: building good writing habits and actually putting words together in a way that makes sense to other people. Knowing the difference between e.g. and i.e. saves your co-authors time explaining it to you. Grammatical errors frustrate reviewers and panelists, and make them skeptical of attention to detail and the quality of the work.\n\nCheck out this Nature article “Kick-Start Writing”\n\n\n\n\nWriting Your Dissertation in 15min/day\nHow to Write Alot\n\n\n\n\n\nStyle: the elements of clarity and grace\nFunk and White\n\n\n\n\n\nThis timeline assumes you have a full rough draft 3 months before a deadline. Prior to this time, make sure you have a target journal and stay within the word limit as you write.\n\nWeek -12: Rough draft ready. A rough draft should not be missing many citations, and should have near-final versions of all the figures and tables.\nWeek -9 to -10: Meeting with co-authors to go over current draft of manuscript, approve methods, decide what figures to include, etc. Keep in mind this meeting could take a couple of weeks to get on the books (so should be planned in week -11).\nWeek -8: Full draft ready, with high quality figures. Make sure this draft is formatted for submission (e.g. word counts, figure number, etc.).\nWeek - 6 to 7: Two weeks for comments from co-authors. Continue to improve manuscript while waiting for comments.\nWeek -5: Incorporate comments from co-authors. Plan another meeting with co-authors if needed.\nWeek - 4: Make sure final draft is formatted for submission (e.g. word counts, figure number, etc.)\nWeek -2 to -3: Two weeks for final comments from all co-authors.\nWeek -1: Fine editing, grammar, figure references, bibliography edits. Leave 2-3 hours for submission.\n\n\n\n\nEvery manuscript typically has 3 parts that I submit, the text of the manuscript (written collaboratively in google docs), the figures with legends (in latex), and the supplement (in latex). I use LaTex for figures and supplements because it makes them high quality, and is easier to control the size of the figures as they are displayed on the page.\n\n\nHere is a link to a template, with important things to remember about writing * Having links to relevant documents at the top of the manuscript can be helpful, including a link to the editor letter, response to reviewers, notes and unused text, etc.\n\nGoogle docs offers a platform for collaboration that does not involve emailing each other many versions, which is inefficient. All changes are available immediately to everyone. It also has a good version control system (Click on “All changes saved in Drive”). I use this system to name specific drafts that I may want to go back to.\n\nUse “Outlines”. Labeling different sections with headers and sub-headers will automatically create an outline. “View —> Show Document Outline” can make it fast to navigate.\n\nHave a separate document for notes, logs, deleted text, and posting old versions of the figures or trial versions of figures.\nMake sure to use text to create tables, because typesetters will not be happy if you create images or LaTeX tables\nI like to have a shared folder with pdfs of all the references\nHave a target journal and stay within the word limit as you write.\n\n\n\n\n\nA good way to frustrate reviewers is to submit high resolution figures in an online system that appends them to the end of your manuscript with no Figure ID or legend.\nTo make my reviewer’s life easier, I use LaTeX to create on figures document with figure legends on the same page as the figures. When the final (final) document is accepted for publication, then I just upload the high resolution figures. Template\nIt will be important to double check that the Figure Legends in the Manuscript match the Figure Legends in the LaTeX document\n\n\n\n\n\nI use the same LaTex template to produce high-quality Supplementary Materials. Template\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI use the ICMJE Vancouver Protocol. It is important to run this by all authors at the beginning of a collaboration, and again at publication.\n\n\n\n\n\nAddons –> Get add ons –> search for Paperpile\nIt works best when you search for the webpage or the title of the paper.\nThis system is more efficient than keeping EndNote on your computer, where you have to download the citation and then add it to EndNote to cite it in a word processor.\nAt the bottom of the app is an “Open Paperpile” link, which provides some extra functionality\nTo add all your citations in a document to Paperpile, you can click on a reference in the Bibliography, click “Open”, then click on “View all references from this Document”, then in the upper right hand corner click on the icon and “Add all references to my library”\n\n\n\n\n\nSet aside 15 minutes first thing every morning to engage with the manuscript.\nCreate an outline (through discussions with all authors) and stick to it\nStart with methods, and be sure to update them every time you do the actual method. It is important to be as specific as possible (e.g. kit manufacturer, name of the piece of equipment you used) to ensure the results are reproducible.\nA well-framed research question should allow you to write the introduction before the results are known. In the Introduction you should lay out the rationale for the study, including the questions or hypotheses to be addressed.\nI find it helpful to draw text from the papers I am citing or reading if I get stuck in a writing block, and then going back to edit it later.\nAs you start to work on a section, the most important thing is to maintain communication and discussions with all authors, especially if what you write strays from the outline. You may be wasting effort and taking the manuscript in a direction that is different from what others envision.\nAdding comments to sections that you are working on and how you plan to improve them, or questions you have on how to improve them, can help co-authors understand where your thought process is.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery detail matters. Be prepared to spend 4-8 hours or more refining a figure, even after you get a general figure that everyone agrees on.\n\nCommon mistakes:\n\nAll axes labels are centered. There are no redundant axis labels in multi-panel plots.\ny-axis tick labels are not sideways\nThe color pattern works in B&W and for color blind. There are color-blind palettes in R, and there are websites online where you can see how your figure works for a color blind person.\nNo 3-D plots.\ny-axis scale does not accentuate differences in the effect size (in other words not zoomed in)\nBase R plotting options:\n\nbty = \"l\" box type is “L” shaped and not a square outline\nlas = 1 y-axis tick labels are upright\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare the google doc with co-authors and colleagues for feedback. It can take a couple weeks to get it back from them, and don’t be afraid to follow up if they are taking too long. After that it can take a few or several weeks to make edits and changes. While you are waiting on them, you can work on some of the points below.\n\n\n\n\nThe final stages prior to submission can take about a month or more.\n\nI like to go through all the references in my folder and skim them over again. As I read them over, I double check that they are cited correctly, and often I find other places to cite them, which helps to weave common threads throughout. Especially if I am first author, I want to be familiar with the papers that others cited but I haven’t read before. This process takes me a couple weeks of 4-5 hours per day.\nWrite your letter to the editor. Template\nCheck the author guidelines for the journal you are submitting to and make sure all sections of the manuscript fit those guidelines.\nIn the “Data Accessibility” section I often put “All datasets and scripts used to create results will be archived on Dryad upon final acceptance of the manuscript. Scripts can currently be seen at the github site XXXX.” (Beware if double blind review, you may not want to put the github site)\nDo not count on co-authors to find mistakes and grammatical errors. I have read over manuscripts 10+ times and there are still errors.\nEdit for unneccessary words or long sentences.\nAttention to detail is paramount. Every error that a reviewer finds is a mental check that other important details may have been overlooked in the research.\nWriting Author Contributions. Communication here is paramount. It can help to send this list to each author and let them tell you where they think they should have their initials by. Who:\n\nconceptualized and administered the project,\nobtained funding\ndeveloped methods\ncollected data\ndid the formal analysis\nvisualized the data\nwrote the software\nperformed data curation\nwrote the original draft of the manuscript\nAll authors reviewed and edited the manuscript.\n\nBe sure to have page and line numbers. There is an “Line Numbers for Google Docs Add On”\nEdit all references in the Bibliography (this is the very last thing you do). Paperpile often has errors, especially with capitalization. You do not want to have a reviewer find their name was spelled wrong in your reference list, so check also for special characters. Species italics is another thing that often needs to be edited.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to submission, get final approval (in writing) from all authors and agreement that all authors are accountable for mistakes or errors per ICJMES policy.\nWhen I first started submitting manuscripts, I had to go through multiple attempts because I kept making edits or changes to the manuscript. Just wait until everything is perfect and do it once.\nAfter you submit, name your draft in google drive. (Click on “All changes saved in Drive”). Save the draft as a Word Document, which will be used below if a “track changes” document is needed in the response to reviews.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour baseline expectation should be a rejection with extensive comments from reviewers.\nInvolve all authors in responding to reviews, communication is important here. Take every review seriously, even if they are being ridiculous. A good editor will emphasize the good reviews and de-emphasize the ridiculous ones.\nBe respectful when responding to reviews, and be sure to note which comments were helpful. Also be sure to note where there is disagreement among reviewers when responding to comments.\nBe sure to acknowledge the Editor and anonymous reviewers in your “Acknowledgments” section\nIt is good to submit a “track changes” document. Microsoft word has a great system for comparing 2 documents. After all authors approve the final revisions with all changes accepted, export the manuscript to .docx. In Word, go to “Tools –> Track Changes –> Compare Documents”. Upload the draft that was submitted the first time around. Word will produce a document showing all changes between the two documents, which you can submit with your review.\n\n\n\n\n\nArchiving data and scripts on Dryad. Ensure that the scripts are still reproducible by running them on your computer and someone else’s. Once you upload to Dryad, that’s it - you can’t go back and edit or change something.\n\nDryad has specific instructions for compressing and transferring large files, so initiate communication with them before you start this process. Make sure everything is perfect, then compress the folder with all data and scripts per Dryad instructions.\nThe process of getting a DOI can take about a week. After you get the DOI, add the data citation to your Bibliography per Dryad instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you receive the proofs, you typically have 48 hours to make corrections and send them back. It is good to share with co-authors if they have the time, but typically it is up to the first author to make corrections.\nRead through the entire proofs, and don’t just focus on the questions from the typesetters. There will still be mistakes and grammatical errors to be found.\n\n\n\n\n\nCelebrate!"

They will come around to each of the labs that have filled out the online pick up sheet on the last Tuesday of every month.\nAt this same time, Clean harbors should bring the extra hazardous waste containers that have been requested by members of the lab.\nIf our secondary containment is overflowing in the middle of the month, notify Ryan and he will transport the containers to the central accumulation area.\nLastly, do your best to fill out the hazardous waste labels correctly. Use the SDS of the chemical that you have been working with to help fill out the label.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first door on the right as you enter the hall where labs are located is the shared lab space.

    "text": "Managing Chemical Inventory\nEdit this page\n\nChemicals (including kits) purchased by any lab member, for any purpose, and stored in one of our labs (Edwards bldg and bunker lab) MUST be barcoded and added to our chemical inventory which is hosted in the BioRAFT platform.\n\nThis is done at the container/individual kit level (i.e., not at the chemical substance or class level) - for example, if we have 3 bottles of ethanol in the inventory and buy a new one, that individual new bottle must be assigned its own barcode and added to the inventory.\n\n\n1. As soon as a new chemical/kit is delivered to our lab, assign it a barcoded label. You MUST use the barcoded labels provided by Northeastern’s EHS. They start with “NU000” followed by a unique ID number.\nAlways place the label where it is easier to see (i.e., not on the bottom of the container, where you’d have to lift the bottle to find it). I typically place it right above the main label.\n\n\n2. Add chemical/kit to the lab’s chemical inventory.\n\nGo to the lab’s BioRAFT page: Lotterhos Lab > Lab Profile\nClick on the ChemTracker tab > Add inventory\nSearch chemical/kit by name, name or CAS number1\nFill out all required fields\nUnique container ID is where you enter the unique barcode ID\nClick Submit\n\n\n\n3. Remove items from the inventory when chemicals/kits are used up, expired or disposed of for any reason.\n\nRemove the barcode label and discard it in the trash (i.e., don’t stick it to any other surface and don’t reuse it for another chemical).\nGo to the lab’s BioRAFT page: Lotterhos Lab > Lab Profile\nClick on the ChemTracker tab > Chem Tracker\nAt the bottom of the page, scroll right until you find the “Container ID” and the “Remove” columns\nClick “Remove” and confirm “Remove” to exclude the entry from the inventory.\nRinse and deface the bottle, then discard or reuse to store chemical waste.\n\nDiscard a defaced bottle: label the bottle using an “empty container” label.\nReuse a defaced bottle: label the bottle with a “empty container” label until you start using it for waste and replace it with a “Chemical Waste Label” once you star using it for waste.\n\n\nGo to Chem Tracker (Lotterhos Lab > Lab Profile > ChemTracker tab > ChemTracker) to View and/or Edit the inventory; you can also export the inventory to an excel spreadsheet if you need to sort or print the full list - this is useful when doing self-inspections and inventory checks.\n\nCAS registry numbers are unique, unmistakable identifiers for chemical substances. A CAS Registry Number itself has no inherent chemical significance but provides an unambiguous way to identify a chemical substance or molecular structure when there are many possible systematic, generic, proprietary or trivial names. CAS Registry Numbers are used in many other public and private databases as well as chemical inventory listings and, of course, are included in all CAS-produced databases. ↩︎"

From the tapestation we still see the final product in S2 and S3 (the original custom i5 and the new short custom i5,respectively) were the same as the target size of the sheared DNA (150bp). There is also a spike at small bp (~70-80bp) which indicates that some dimer might be present."

    "text": "Protocols and tips for collecting samples for DNA extraction\n\n\n\nWith next generation sequencing, it is important to consider all possible sources of contamination when collecting samples. It is also important to consider downstream analysis that may be affected by the method of preservation for collected samples. For example, best results for DNA extraction will come from flash-frozen DNA. For whole genome sequencing, DNA methylation and bisulfite sequencing, flash-frozen DNA is also the preferred collection method, but DNA stored in ethanol or OGLFix can also be used, as long as samples are not stored for a long time. It is very important that we all make the upmost effort to ensure that the samples are collected using sterile materials and appropriate technique, and that samples are well preserved, with the method of preservation well documented. Care and attention in sample collection for DNA extraction will ensure that time and resources are spent on good quality samples and are the first steps to obtaining a robust and reliable dataset.\n\n\n\n\nPrepare ahead of time: All sample vials used to store tissue for DNA extraction should be sterilized by autoclaving ahead of time. Screw-cap cryovials are preferred (Fisher, cat #10-500-26). Be sure to get trained (online course and in-person training by OGL personnel) before using the autoclave. Make a list of all other materials needed to collect samples and autoclave what is autoclavable ahead of time. Remember to gather boxes, gloves and other PPE.\nSmart label and metadata: In general, it is best practice to have tubes organized in a box, with at least 2 labels on each tube (in case one falls off). We have a barcode label printer (with freezer-proof labels) that can be used. Label the vials with species name or initials, and sample ID. Make sure to have unique sample IDs for each sample for your entire project. Label boxes with species name, project name, your initials, sampling date and location ahead of time. Make a spreadsheet listing the sample IDs and columns to record all other info and data about the study site, individuals and samples (lat/long, size and weight of animals, experimental treatment, etc).\nAvoid cross-contamination: If possible, use a sterilized surface to handle or collect tissue or samples. Sterilize surface with 10% bleach, UV light and/or 70% ethanol, or use sterile plastic weigh boats. Always wear gloves. For anything that comes in contact with the animals and samples, use sterile disposable materials, one per individual, whenever possible. If using blades, use sterile blades or wipe each blade and all other materials (forceps, spatulas, etc) with 70% ethanol between individuals to avoid cross-contamination. If available, flame the blades to burn off the excess ethanol and further sterilize them. Be sure to get all bits of tissue off the blade and into the sample vial. Remember to dispose of sharps in a sharps container.\nAmount of tissue sample: Collect an appropriate amount of tissue, so there will be enough sample to repeat or troubleshoot extraction if needed, and to archive the remaining tissue for future studies, to use as positive controls, etc. Typically, that means 1 to 1.5 inch piece of tissue. Use your best judgment to make sure that the entire tissue sample is submersed in fixative liquid (if that is your method of preservation). A sample that is too small may not yield enough DNA to proceed with sequencing and a sample that is too big for the vial may not be preserved well as the amount of preservative liquid in the vial may not permeate the whole tissue (see photo below).\nStorage: Samples can be stored temporarily in liquid N2 but should be stored short term in the -20oC freezer and long term in the -80oC freezer. Minimize the amount of time that you keep the -80oC freezer door open and do not let the temperature rise above -70oC (this will set off the freezer alarms). Be mindful of the location you select to store your boxes in the -80oC freezer - we have an inventory that needs to be checked ahead of time and filled out to keep track of where samples are. Using the inventory helps minimizing the time that de freezer door is open when storing or retrieving boxes.\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to get trained by OGL personnel beforehand if using the liquid N2 dispenser at NUMSC. Place tissue into labelled cryovials. Make sure to use liquid N2 and -80oC freezer proof labels so they do not fall off. Use protective equipment to handle liquid N2: cryogenic gloves, closed-toe shoes, lab coat and goggles. Dispense liquid N2 into the dewar flask. Place a sample vials on a long-handle strainer and slowly submerse the strainer into liquid N2 in the dewar, releasing the cryovials into the liquid. If flash-freezing samples in the lab, wait 1-2 min and retreive the vials using the strainer. Make sure to retreive all vials from the dewar. Place cryovials in a storage box and transfer the box to the -80oC freezer. These cryovials are used for flash-freezing and temporary storage-only in liquid N2. If flash-freezing away from the lab, make sure to transfer vials to storage boxes and into the -80oC freezer as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nUse regular grade 95% ethanol. Calculate how much ethanol will be needed for all samples you are collecting and pour that volume plus little extra from the stock ethanol container (stored into the flammables cabinet) into a beaker or another container of appropriate volume. You may need to adjust the concentration of ethanol, e.g., from 100% to 95% - use ultrapure water (MiliQ) or molecular grade water to do this dilution. Pre-fill screw-cap vials with 1.5-2mL of 95% ethanol using a pipette. Make sure to sumberse the whole tissue into ethanol so the liquid can permeate the whole tissue (see photo below). If samples preserved in ethanol are being shipped via FedEx, UPS, etc, you might need a Special or Hazardous Shipping form, label and to follow specific packaging instructions. Contact lab manager before shipping containers with ethanol.\n\n\n\nOGLFix can be used instead of ethanol to preserve tissue for DNA extraction. Follow the same instructions described above for ethanol (no dilution needed). OGLFix can be shipped without hazardous designation. As for ethanol preservation, it is critical the the entire tissue is submersed in fixative. Refer to the OGLFix sampling protocol for detailed instructions.\n\n\n\nSampling protocol immerse\n\n\n\n\n\nSamplingprotocolsize"

    "text": "The protocol for keeping track of different versions using GitHub\n\n\n\nIn running bioinformatics pipelines and analyzing data, a user often makes hundreds of changes to his/her code and ends up with multiple versions of the same file with slight differences. Using version control allows you to keep track of different versions as you progress through your work. GitHub is a great platform to track the changes in your work, share with collaborators, and have a backup online.\nRead more about using git in the terminal in Vince Buffalo’s textbook\n\n\n\nMost major projects in the lab will have their own git repository. If you are starting a project that will have a lot of coding involved, you should discuss with Katie about starting a new repository and how you will manage data, code, and directories. The easiest way to utilize GitHub is to do the following:\n\nMake sure you have GitHub Desktop downloaded (you can use the Terminal, but this is much more user-friendly, especially for beginners)\nLog in to your GitHub account (or create one if you don’t have one)\nFind the repository on GitHub that was created by Katie\nOn the main repository page you should see a green button towards the right of the screen that says ‘Clone or download’. Click this button\nYou can either copy the https and use git clone https... in the directory that you want the git repository, or you can choose ‘Open in Desktop’ which opens up the GitHub Desktop app, and allows you to choose which directory it will be cloned to.\nYou can then make changes on your local directory\nAfter you have made sufficient changes that you want to save and share, you need to commit these changes\nGitHub Desktop will keep track of these changes, which will appear in the left column of the app (make sure you’ve specified the right directory in the top navigation bar)\nTo commit these changes, select the changes you want to commit, then type a message in the summary box and click ‘Commit to <repository>’\n\nIt’s good practice to commit groups of changes separately depending on what you changed. For example, if you edited three text documents and added an image to the directory, you could commit the text documents with the summary ‘edited text documents’ then separately commit the image with the summary ‘added image’. This makes it so mass changes aren’t all assigned the same summary message\n\nThen in the upper right corner, on the black navigation bar, it should give you the option to push these commits to the main repository on GitHub. Do so by clicking on the box.\nIf changes have been made on the online GitHub repository, you will need to ‘pull’ these before pushing your commits (essentially, making sure you have the most up-to-date versions of files before making changes). You do this by choosing ‘pull’ in the upper right hand box, and then you can ‘push’ your changes."

Align the arrows between the logger and shuttle coupler for proper connection\nUse miniUSB to connect the logger to the computer. Unscrew white cap on shuttle to access the cord port\nOpen HoboWare\nIn the bottom left bar of the program you will see that the software recognizes your device (‘Dev: HOBO Waterproof Shuttle U-DTW-1…’). It will 1 device connected in lower right bar. This does not mean the shuttle has been properly started and connected\nTo properly start and connect the logger press the coupler lever\n\n\n\nThis starts the logger and you should see a ‘Installing device drive software’ message on your screen\nWhen the software has been installed, it should then say ‘USB Input Device’\nThe device name in the lower left bar of the HOBOWare program should now be correct\nTo get some basic information about the logger, go to ‘Device’ in the menu bar, then choose ‘Status’ This gives basic information about the logger such as the device name, serial number, battery state, etc. ** You should use a Dixon standard (saltwater standard) to get an initial Conductivity reading form this Status pane before initializing**\nTo launch the logger, go to ‘Device’ -> ‘Launch’\nChange the name to something meaningful like ‘20180615_Barnstable_conductivity’\nChoose the logging interval and when to start logging (when the logger will be deployed) THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT: When you choose the logging interval, check the ‘Logs until’ time in the pane above it to see how long it will take before the storage runs out. If your interval is too small, the logger will fill up before you can offload the data and continue measuring\nClick ‘Start’ and logger will launch\nUnplug from the computer\nPlace rubber cap that comes with the logger on cylindrical end to prevent scratches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinderblock\nMetal tubing straps to attach PVC fixed loggers to\nZipties\nPVC pipe large and long enough to fit logger, “swiss-cheesed’ with holes There must be enough holes for regular flow of water through the PVC pipe.

See this page for water sampling protocol\n\n\n\n\n\nAttach metal straps to cinder block\nAttach PVC pipe to the metal rings that are fastened to the cinderblock\nLabel cinderblock, PVC pipe, buoy, and loggers with contact information (Katie’s)\nMake sure you’ve contacted local shellfish constable to make sure they can keep an eye on the loggers\n\n\n\n\nLoggers should be deployed at low tide, so that we know they’ll be constantly exposed to water while logging\n\nBefore deploying, attach logger(s) to PVC using many zipties\nWade to waist-deep water at site of deployment\nDeploy logger\nRecord time of deployment.

    "text": "Workflow parallelization approaches:\na. One the shared resources, limits on each partition are determined according to the following table: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/hardware/partitions.html#introduction. If your jobs have exceeded those limits, this may have been the cause of job terminations.\nb. On the “lotterhos” partition, you do not have any restrictions on number of submitted jobs, or requested cpus. To submit to the lotterhos partition, simply set the SLURM flag for this partition:\nFor an interactive job (example): srun -p lotterhos --nodes=1 --cpus-per-task=1 --pty --time=24:00:00 /bin/bash\nThis example will allocate a single node with 1 CPU (and –ntasks=1 by default, but alternatively, you can also use this instead:\nsrun -p lotterhos --nodes=1 --ntasks =1 --pty --time=24:00:00 /bin/bash for 24 hours, and flag --pty will set all output to be printed to the screen. /bin/bash is the command to be run for this job, so any bash command after this will be executed.\nIf you run this command, you can type: lscpu to get the hardware info (such as core count).\nFor a batch (background) job, adding the following to your bash script is equivalent:\n#SBATCH -p lotterhos\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --time=24:00:00\nIf your shell script looks the same, and the only thing changing is a particular parameter, for example:\n#SBATCH -p lotterhos\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --time=24:00:00\nprogram input-X output-X\nThen you can also take advantage of the job-array structure to submit multiple jobs at a time. Each SLURM job that is defined as array will have several bash variables associated with this that are defined once the job is submitted. The main important variable that can be useful is: $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID For example, if you create a SLURM array job with 10 jobs in the array, then the values $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID will get are: 1,…,10 (each job in the array will be assigned with a number 1-10, and can be distinguished this way). Here, %10 means all 10 jobs are set to run together. Setting %1 means they will run one after another.\n#SBATCH -p lotterhos\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --time=24:00:00\n#SBATCH --array=1-10:%10\nprogram input-$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID output-$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID\nThis setup will run the program on a specific input file based on the $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID  value (input-1,input-2,…,input-10) and will output the results to output file named based on the value of $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID  (output-1,output-2,…,output-10).\nThere is a hard limit of an array size of 1000 that research computing cannot increase.\nIn addition, this kind of code will not work: #SBATCH —array=1001-1951%68 because the array index goes over 1000 (Even though the number of jobs in the array is less than 1000). So if you have more than 1000 simulations, I don’t recommend the array approach.\n\n\nc. Parallelizing your R script: You can also leverage the entire 36 cores on each on the lotterhos nodes in a single job by using a threading parallelization scheme. Specifically, you can use the parallel processing R libraries such as “foreach” to increase the efficiency of your loops. You can then parallelize specific chunks of your code (mainly, loops) by importing the parallel libraries. For example, if your r code is this:\n#import packages\nlibrary(foreach)\nlibrary(doParallel)\n#number of iterations\niters<-1e4\n#setup parallel backend to use 8 processors\ncl<-makeCluster(36)\nregisterDoParallel(cl)\n#start time\nstrt<-Sys.time()\n#loop\nls<-foreach(icount(iters)) %dopar% {\n    to.ls<-rnorm(1e6)\n    to.ls<-summary(to.ls)\n    to.ls\n    }\nprint(Sys.time()-strt)\nstopCluster(cl)\nsource: https://beckmw.wordpress.com/2014/01/21/a-brief-foray-into-parallel-processing-with-r/\nThen, you can set up an array job that looks like this:\n#SBATCH -p lotterhos\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=36\n#SBATCH --time=24:00:00\n#SBATCH --array=1-10:%10\nr-parallel-program  input-$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID  output-$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID"

If the temperature reaches -65C, wait until it gets back up to -75C before you load more samples. It puts a lot of stress on the freezer.\n\n\n\n\nWe need to contact Dennis Todd to request a 24hr+ freezer alarm shutoff.\n\n\n\n\n\nCryoCube-F570 operating manual\n\n\n1) Find a backup freezer for the samples and confirm that there’s enough space for all contents of our freezer; check the dimensions of the available shelves in the backup freezer to see if it is the same as ours (ideally, transfer whole racks to the equivalent shelf & rack position on the backup freezer to save time and avoid messing up the inventory).\n2) Find help - defrosting can be done by one person, but having a second pair of hands is very helpful and strongly recommended.\n3) Familiarize yourself with the protocol to disable freezer alarms (see above), with the materials that need to be on hand to defrost & clean the freezer and the overall protocol/timeline described below.\n\n\n\n4) Before you begin, double-check that the backup freezer(s)’ alarm was disabled (see above instructions); request that our alarm is disabled remotely for 24h by emailing Dennis Todd @ northeastern; gather:\n\nfreezer mittens\nlab cart\na mop or large towel\n‘wet floor’ sign\na cooler or large styrofoam box for lose boxes/bags\na bucket to collect water\nclean cloths to wipe the freezer\n\n5) WEARING FREEZER MITTENS, transfer whole racks to the backup freezer: place all 5 racks from one shelf on our lab cart; roll the cart to the backup freezer and place them on the equivalent shelf and in the same order as they were on our freezer. Do this one shelf at the time until the freezer is empty.\n\ntransfer racks in and out of freezers carefully but quickly to minimize temp rising - note that the drawers slide open, so keep the racks horizontal; monitor both freezer’s temp as you transfer - shouldn’t rise above -65oC.\n\n6) Once empty:\n\nput up a “wet floor” sign,\nclose the CO2 cylinder valve,\nswitch off the local alarm box located on top of the freezer,\nunlock the switch locking plate (front-bottom-right side of the freezer) and switch off the battery (top) and the main (bottom) switches,\nunplug the freezer from the wall,\nopen all doors and let the freezer defrost, use a bucket to catch water dripping from the doors, use a mop to dry up the puddles.\n\n7) Once defrosted: wipe the whole interior of the freezer, the inner and outer doors and the seal using clean microfiber cloths (under the lab sink) until completely dry.\n8) Reverse to bring freezer back up: close all doors, plug freezer back up, switch on main switch/battery switch and lock up the locking plate, switch on alarm box up on top of the freezer. Monitor temperature to ensure that it is appropriately decreasing all the way to -80oC.\n\nduring this stage, the freezer alarm may go off (not the alarms associated with the remote system), just mute it using the door pannel keys.\n\n\n\n\n9) Disable our freezer alarm for 1h (instructions above). Set a timer for yourself for 55 min because you might need to extend alarm cancellation. Check with the host lab on whether the alarm on the backup freezer needs to be disabled.\n10) WEARING FREEZER MITTENS transfer freezer racks back and ensure they are placed back on the freezer position (shelf & row) where they before - so it continues to match the freezer database. Leave one or two empty racks in the freezer for new boxes. Monitor the temperature of both freezers during retrieval to ensure it does not raise above 65oC.\n11) If you need to take a break to allow the temperature to drop, remember to extend the alarm cancellation for another hour.\n12) Once all samples are back, wait around and make sure that the freezer temp drops down to -80oC.\n\n\n\nOctober 2021 defrost (Thais, Sara and Alan):\n\nOGL was able to hold our samples (MUST coordinate with OGL personnel ahead of time); OGL’s freezers was completely empty, and shelves have the same dimensions as ours (plus an extra shelf); their freezer was not hooked up to an alarme system at the time.\nWe were able to transfer all racks to the equivalent positions into the backup freezer (one shelf at the time) without needing to wait too long for the temperature to stabilize. Because the backup freezer was empty, the temp rose to -58oC when we transferred the first shelf/5 racks.\nOur freezer was defrosted, cleaned/dried and turned back on within 2 hours.\nTransfer-defrost-cleaning took from 11am to 2pm.\nTemp down to -80oC within another 2-3 hours (all done by 5pm).\nThe CO2 valve was reopened the following day.\nThe following week, we transferred the racks back. Temp went up to 65oC after 3 shelves were tranferred so we took 1h break, then tranferred the remaining racks and samples.\nTook about 2h for the temp to go back down to -80oC (freezer alarm went off once).\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintenance has been done with: https://alertscientific.com/"

If you are working in a conda environment, it won’t detect programs loaded in the module outside that environment\nOne conda environment is lotterhos-py38, which is running python 3.8. Note that many bioinformatics programs are not updated for this environment.

Once you confirm you are part of the unix group and have access to the nodes, you can submit regular jobs using the --partition lotterhos\nThere are 2 nodes each with 36 cores, so we can run parallel programs with up to 36 cores, and serial on up to 72 cores. Our nodes are d3037 and d3038. Please communicate with Dr. L about your project and the best way to use resources, so that everyone in the lab has access if they need it.\nTo get info on the nodes type sinfo -p lotterhos, which gives the node IDs, and lscpu ##### to get info on the CPUs for that node.\nscontrol show partition lotterhos shows what we can do. There are no limits on job submissions, the default time is 7 days with a max of 30 days. When you type the code, you can see MaxTime=30-00:00:00\nsqueue -p lotterhos shows what is current running. You definitely want to check this before you try to srun (see below) or submit jobs!\nThere is 5GB of memory on each core, with 36 cores/node and 72 cores total across both. So it should be possible to submit an array with 140 jobs at a time, each with 2.5 GB memory, but I haven’t tried it yet.\nIf you are on campus, or offcampus using NU’s VPN, you can use this webpage to view resources: https://xdmod.rc.northeastern.edu/\n\n\n\nTo develop code and troubleshoot, there is a debug partition.

    "text": "General Directory Organization\nThe protocol for maintaining consistency when creating directories\n\nFor each new project you’ll want to have a dedicated folder to contain all major data files and code script related to that project. Even if you are re-using scripts that are already located in another project’s folder, consider copying that code over into your new projects’ folder, instead of reading it from another location.\nThe guiding principle should be that you want to be able to run your whole project’s code (barring any software you have to download) using the scripts that are located within that projects’ folder. That way, if you ever have to move your project files to another computer, you won’t be missing any scripts on which you’re dependent.\nSo once you’ve made a new project folder, for example by using the mkdir command in the terminal\n> mkdir NewProject\nyou’ll want to navigate into that folder (cd NewProject) and create subdirectories to house specific file types.\nTwo good startig folders to have are a src folder and a results folder. An src folder (derived from “source”), should house all the core scripts necessary for your project. So all novel R scripts, Python code, Perl pipelines you’ve dredged up, etc. would be housed here. The results folder would house all output files generated by scripts in src.\nDepending on the project, you’ll want to have a data folder to keep the raw data sets that you yourself did not generate with the scripts in src.\nFinally, you’ll want to create a simple text README file that explicitly states what subdirectories you have in your project folder, and what they should contain. Ideally you should have a README file in each directory that states what files it contains.\nA README file written in markdown could look like this:\n# Files for New Project by Student McGee and PI ForFree, Year Month(s)\n\nShort description of New Project\n\n## Description of each folder or file and the data contained within:\n  src - What scripts are here?\n  results - What kind of result files are here?\n  data - What sort of data?\nOnce you’ve set up your project folder, it should look something like this:\n\nQuick notes: simfiles folder results folder src folder"

See autoclave training information if this is your first lab work at the MSC!\nWhen using plates, it can be more difficult to keep track of which samples go in which wells, since you can not label wells directly. It is advised to draw the layout of the plate and plan sample allocation on to the wells ahead of time, and keep that layout near by for reference during tissue digestion prep. Also, make sure to keep plates in the same orientation (top left corner A-1) at all times.\n\n\n\n\n\nReserve plate centrifuge in Hughes lab if using plates.\nMake sure kit purification buffers are diluted as directed in the kit manual.\n\n\n\n\nD1-1. Set thermomixer to desired temperature and rpm (typically 60oC and 450 RPM, but may vary if you are tweaking the protocol).\nD1-2. Sterilize surfaces and area around the scale - wipe with with 10 % bleach first, then DI H2O, then 70-90% EtOH.\nD1-3. Remove tissue samples from freezer and let thaw (do not let them sit any longer than necessary). Take ~10 samples at the time. Once thawed they can be placed on ice/cold beads.\nD1-4. Pre-load lysis plate or sterile eppendorf tubes with 200 uL of TL buffer per well plate or tube using a serile pipette tip.\nD1-5. Tare scale with a piece of weighing paper on it.\nD1-6. Dip ONLY the cutting edge of the blade into EtOH in beaker. Move the beaker aside. Hold the blade vertically, away from your body and away from the EtOH beaker and flame the blade. When all EtOH has burned off and the flame is gone, set the sterile blade on a clean kimwipe on the bench. Dip the tip of the forceps into EtOH beaker, move the beaker aside. Hold the forceps horizontally, away from your body and from the EtOH beaker and flame the forceps to sterilize.\nD1-7. Using the sterile forceps, carefully remove tissue from 2mL tube and set it on the kimwipe. Using the sterile razor blade, cut a piece of tissue 15-20 mg. Pat dry the piece of tissue with a clean kimwipe, so that the tissue appears nearly dry.\nD1-8. Place tissue on weigh paper and record the weight in lab notebook. If the tissue weights less than 15mg or more than 20mg, remove or add more tissue as needed to reach this range.\nD1-9. Take the weigh paper out of the scale, set it on a clean kimwipe and use the sterile forceps and blade to cut up the tissue into smaller pieces.\nD1-10. Transfer the cut up tissue to a well plate or an eppendorf tube, making sure that all pieces of tissue fall into the buffer.\nD1-11. Label the tube with sample ID, or keep track of the plate layout on your lab notebook, so you know which samples are in which wells.\nD1-12. Discard the used blade into the sharps container. Discard all used kimwipes and wipe the bench again with 70-90% EtOH.\n\nNote: Between samples, a new blade should be used if available and forceps should be sterilized by diping in EtOH and flaming to burn off any residual EtOH and tissue.\n\nD1-13. Repeat steps 5-12 until all samples are in buffer.\nD-14. Add 25uL of OB Protease Solution (OB Protease and Proteinase K, provided with the kit, serve the same purpose as digestive buffers) to each sample tube or well plate. You can reuse the tip if you are sure that the tip did not touch the liquid or the sides of the tubes or wells. If the tip does touch any surfaces in the lysis plate or tubes, replace with a sterile tip.\nD-15. Close tubes or seal plate with a silicone mat, confirm all tubes or plate wells are labelled correctly and vortex the tubes/plate for 15 seconds.\nD-16. Place samples on thermomixer. Before restarting the mixer: Make sure all tube caps are securely fastened/plate is securely sealed. In addition, after 2 minutes on the thermomixer confirm the tube caps/silicone mat have not popped open.\nNote: Samples can be left for at least 3 hours or overnight to allow for all tissue to be completely lysed. If possible, pause the mixer, take plate/tubes out and vortex them for 15 sec every 1/2h to 1h to help with lysis.\n\n\n\nD2-1. Sterilize bench top - wipe with with 10% bleach first, then DI H2O, then 70-90% EtOH.\nD2-2. Heat up heating block (or check oven temperature in Hughes lab) to 70oC and place the volume needed of elution buffer (or molecular grade water) in it.\nD2-3. Follow the kit manual for plates or individual tubes for DNA purification with the following modifications, if needed:\n\nskip the optional step “add RNAase”\nskip the optional step “column equilibration”\nwhen centrifuging the lysis plate and the E-Z 96 DNA plate (mini-columns plate), tape them together.\nskip the optional step “dry samples at 70oC”\nwe prefer to use molecular grade water as the elution buffer instead of the kit buffer.\nelution volume may vary depending on starting material and extraction yield. Minimum volume is 30 uL, to ensure that the entire memembrane is soaked with elution buffer.\nthe second elution can be eluted into a separate tube, if there are concerns about DNA concentration in the first elution.\nAlign the tubes in the centrifuge in this manner:\n\nimage\nD2-4. You will likely need to spot-check the concentration of your extracted DNA, either by Qubit or Picogreen assay. Both are destructive assays, meaning you will need to use some aliquote (typically 1-2 uL) of your eluted DNA to measure concentration. Make note of how much you used from which samples, to keep track of how much is available for downstream library prep and sequencing.\nD2-5. Extracted DNA can be place in fridge for a few days, or store at -20oC or -80oC for long term storage. Avoid numerous freeze-thaw cycles."

    "text": "Brief review of using the #SBATCH --array slurm argument to restrict the number of jobs running in parallel on Discovery. Arrays seem to be most effective when you have a large number of jobs that all require the same number of resources and the user wants to limit the amount of the computing resource being used at a particular time. This guide follows the same template format from the lotterhos wiki, which reads through and leverages a reference file that contains a number of file names corresponding to files you wish to process. For example, this cod contain a list of raw sequence files (e.g., fq.gz) that you with to perform trimming and qc on.\n\n\nThe --array argument can take a single integer,1, or a range, 1-32, of integers that the slurm script will iterate through. Following the range of integers you specify the number of these values you wish to process simultaneously using the % operator. For example, if you wish to iterate through the range of integers in batches of 4 you could code: #SBATCH --array=1-32%4\nOther options\n# A job array with array tasks numbered 1, 2, 5, 19, 27.\n#SBATCH --array=1,2,5,19,27\n\n# A job array with array tasks numbered 1, 3, 5 and 7.\n#SBATCH --array=1-7:2\n\n\n\nIncluding the above example (#SBATCH --array=1-32%4) in your slurm script will effectively iterate through your slurm script 32 times, by running 4 simultaneous instances (or jobs) of the script at a time on Discovery. However, running the same script with identical parameters (or files) may not be particularly useful. Instead we probably want to run the same script but apply it to a different set of data or use different parameters. At the very least we want to be able to create unique outputs for each iteration!\nConviently, the --array argument creats a unix variable - SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID, which in the case above references the specific integer that corresponds to the particular instances of the script. For example, the first iteration of your slurm script will have SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID=1.\nThis could be leveraged in multiple ways, but one option is using this index to extract specific lines from a reference script. The data on these lines could be anything, but having file names is a particular useful approach if you want to apply your script to multiple files.\nShort illustration\nVARNAME=`sed \"${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}q;d\" path/to/reference/reference.txt`\n\nfile1 = path/to/data/${VARNAME}\n\necho '${file1}'\nExample of reference file:\ndatafile1.csv\ndatafile2.csv\ndatafile3.csv\nExample output in .out file\ndatafile1.csv\ndatafile2.csv\ndatafile3.csv\n\n\n\nThe lotterhos partition has 2 nodes, 36 cores per node, and 5GB per core. A job that only uses a single cpu should not take up more than 5GB of memory.\nHere is an example of an array that runs 72 jobs at a time, each job runs on one core. In the remaining script, not shown, is code that reads the input parameters from a file that has 1000 lines (the first line is the header, and each line after that has parameters). Hence, the array starts on line 2 and goes to line 1000. Unless the program is able to cross-talk among nodes (most do not have the architecture to do that), then nodes should always be set to 1. However, this script will run arrays across both lotterhos nodes (the nodes=1 just indicates that each task will use one node).\n#SBATCH --partition=lotterhos\n#SBATCH --mem=5GB\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --array=2-1000%70\n1000 is the upper limit that can be requested by the “array” command. It’s also good to keep the total number of jobs submitted at a time capped at 70, so that a couple of cores are left open for srun\nBelow is an example of a job that calls a program that can use multiple cpus. If 32 cpus are requested, then 32 cpus * 5GB/cpu = 160GB can be also requested for memory. Unless the program is able to cross-talk among nodes (most do not have the architecture to do that), then nodes should always be set to 1. y Since there are only 2 nodes, each with 36 cpus, then we can only run 2 jobs at a time and stay within the bounds of the architecture. Hence thearray=2-1000%2 argument\n#SBATCH --partition=lotterhos\n#SBATCH --mem=160GB\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=32\n#SBATCH --array=2-1000%2\n\n\n\nScript performs bismark mapping, bismark on list of files based on the file names in a reference text file, sample_files.txt.

    "text": "Steps to take if errors occur during installation\n\nWhen initially trying to use CellProfiler, I had some issues during the installation process. This was primarily due to the fact that CellProfiler only uses Python 2.7 (They are developing a new version that will be built on Python 3) and is fairly sensitive to versions of libraries it needs. Also, I was having some issues with permissions as well. I will walk through these issues here.\n\n\nOne subtle mistake that person could make during the installation process is not using the correct version of pip. Given that there are separate versions of pip for Python 2.7 and for Python 3, you could just be mistakenly trying to install CellProfiler with the wrong version of pip. I say this because the command install CellProfiler is this:\nuser@comp5:~/Cellprofiler$ pip install -e .\nSeems pretty straightforward but that assumption could lead to some trouble. The pip command could be specifying either pip for python 2.7 or some version of python3. There should be a pip2.7 command to specify which of the two versions you are trying to use. Use this command. If you do not do this, you will likely get an error saying that you do not have the correct version of Python and you will be confused.\nThis also applies to prerequisite libraries you are installing as well.\n\n\n\nAnother issue that you might run into when installing is permission errors. Here is what I got when I ran the command for installation suggested by CellProfiler documentation:\nuser@comp5:~/Cellprofiler$ pip2.7 install -e .\n\nERROR: Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/bin/cellprofiler'\nConsider using the `--user` option or check the permissions.\nYou can try to run it with the --user flag as suggested but this is what I got when I did that:\nuser@comp5:~/Cellprofiler$ pip2.7 install -e . --user\n\nERROR: Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/bin/cellprofiler'\nCheck the permissions.\nThe only way that I was able to get by these permission errors was to install it using sudo:\nuser@comp5:~/Cellprofiler$ sudo pip2.7 install -e .\n\n\n\nNow this is where a installation complication lies. Proper installation of certain libraries and packages is incredibly important on RedHat systems and it really matters here. If you do not so this you will get an error that looks like this:\nNotice: /Stage[main]/Neutron::Db::Sync/Exec[neutron-db-sync]/returns: ImportError: cannot import name UnrewindableBodyError Error: /Stage[main]/Neutron::Db::Sync/Exec[neutron-db-sync]: Failed to call refresh: neutron-db-manage upgrade heads returned 1 instead of one of [0] Error: /Stage[main]/Neutron::Db::Sync/Exec[neutron-db-sync]: neutron-db-manage upgrade heads returned 1 instead of one of [0] Notice: /Stage[main]/Neutron::Deps/Anchor[neutron::service::begin]: Triggered 'refresh' from 1 events Error: Failed to apply catalog: Execution of '/usr/bin/nova-manage cell_v2 list_cells --verbose' returned 1: Traceback (most recent call last): File \"/usr/bin/nova-manage\", line 6, in <module> from nova.cmd.manage import main File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nova/cmd/manage.py\", line 77, in <module> from nova.api.ec2 import ec2utils File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nova/api/ec2/ec2utils.py\", line 25, in <module> from nova import cache_utils File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nova/cache_utils.py\", line 22, in <module> import nova.conf File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nova/conf/__init__.py\", line 27, in <module> from nova.conf import cinder File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nova/conf/cinder.py\", line 16, in <module> from keystoneauth1 import loading as ks_loading File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keystoneauth1/loading/__init__.py\", line 13, in <module> from keystoneauth1.loading import adapter File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keystoneauth1/loading/adapter.py\", line 13, in <module> from keystoneauth1 import adapter File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keystoneauth1/adapter.py\", line 18, in <module> from keystoneauth1 import session File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keystoneauth1/session.py\", line 26, in <module> import requests File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/__init__.py\", line 43, in <module> import urllib3 File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/urllib3/__init__.py\", line 8, in <module> from .connectionpool import ( File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py\", line 35, in <module> from .connection import ( File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/urllib3/connection.py\", line 44, in <module> from .util.ssl_ import ( File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/urllib3/util/__init__.py\", line 4, in <module> from .request import make_headers File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/urllib3/util/request.py\", line 5, in <module> from ..exceptions import UnrewindableBodyError ImportError: cannot import name UnrewindableBodyError\nIf you have urllib3 installed via pip, and requests installed via yum you will have this issue, even if you have the correct packages installed.

Public keys can be created following the steps here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/creating-ssh-keys-776639788.html And is described in\n\nAsk Stefan to give you access to /shared_lab directory\nStefan has pre-installed a lot of packages on compliance. Click here for a complete list, including version numbers.\nIf you require additional programs while using cluster, you’ll need to ask Stefan to install it. E-mail him the software and version, and he should have it installed within 24 hours.\n\n\n\nDefiance is set up with a main node (where you log in) and compute nodes Not all files/folder map perfectly across the main node and compute nodes Each user has their own remote repository that is private\n\n\n\nAfter Gaining Access from Stefan Log onto cluster by opening Terminal and typing: ssh username@defiance.neu.edu (e.g. ssh br.ford@defiance.neu.edu) You’ll then log onto a computing node. The basic outline of computing nodes is below:\ncomp5 (Lotterhos) comp6 comp7 (Bowen) comp8\nLog onto comp5 by typing: ssh comp5\nYou can only access the /shared_lab directory by logging on to one of the computing nodes (comp5)\nTo transfer files from your computer to a defiance remote directory: First, go to the folder on your computer with the file in it. Then transfer the file(s) into a remote folder my_laptop\\$ scp ./my_file br.ford@defiance.neu.edu:/home/br.ford/br.ford_remote/my_folder\nOr to download to your personal computer from defiance, go to the folder on your computer where you want the file, then: my_laptop\\$ scp br.ford@defiance.neu.edu:/home/br.ford/br.ford_remote/my_folder/my_file .\nTo download the file to a different directory than the one you are currently in, simply replace the ‘.’ at the end of the command with the path to that directory.\n/shared_lab cannot be accessed with scp, so you’ll need to move (mv) things to your remote repository before downloading to your personal computer\n\n\n\nDefiance is a shared resource, so it is important to monitor the resources being used in order to avoid overloading the server. Before beginning any resource-intensive analysis, you should log into comp5 and enter the command htop to bring up the following interface:\n\n\n\nhtop example\n\n\nOne way to immediately get a sense of whether too many resources are being used is to look at the load average, circled in red in this image. These 3 numbers represent the CPU load over the past minute, 5 minutes, and 15 minutes (from left to right). The higher the load average and the longer it has been high, the more concerned you should be. A spike in the load average for the past minute may be ok, but a sustained high load for the past 15 minutes means some processes need to be killed before the server crashes. How high is too high? A common rule of thumb is 0.70 x total number of CPUs. Since we have 72 CPUs on comp5, if you see the load above or approaching 50.0 you should wait for other jobs to finish before starting any new ones.\nThere is also a lot more information htop gives you that you can take into account. The top portion of the screen shows a real-time representation of how much load is on each of the 72 CPUs. In this image you can see that 2.0% of the total capacity of CPU number 38 is being used and none of the others are in use. Directly below the CPU grid is a bar showing the memory usage. 2.92 of 252 GB of memory is being used in this image. The bottom half of the htop display shows a list of processes currently running, the user they belong to, and information about the resources they are using.\nIf you want to check on your jobs only, you can use htop -u followed by your username (ex: htop -u freeman.k) to show only jobs started by your username. This can be useful to check how long your jobs have been running, to make sure they still are running and haven’t been terminated, or to see how much of the server’s capacity you are using.\nIf you would like to run a resource-intensive job without slowing down other jobs on the server, you can use the command nice when you start the job. nice -n 19 <your_program> will start your program with a “niceness” value of 19, meaning it will defer to all other processes when competing for CPU resources. The default niceness value is 0, 19 gives the lowest priority, and -20 gives the highest priority. Only the root user can run processes with negative niceness values."

For example, if you want to remove only txt files older than two days:\nfind /home/br.ford/br.ford_remote/slim/results/*.txt -ctime +2 -print -exec mv {} finished_results \\;\n\n\n\nList just subdirectories in the current directory\nls -d */\n\n\n\nsed -i '' 's/[\"]//g' test.txt\nThe -i argument says to use in-place editing (edit and return file without making another copy), the empty quotes identifies extension of backup file (none, unless you want a backup file), the statement in the quotes specifies: to substitute (s/) quotations ([“]) with nothing (//) globally (g’) in test.txt\n\n\n\nWant to change permissions to a directory and all subdirectories, but are not sure which chmod arguments to use to do so recursively?\nUse mac GUI: \n\n\n\nwc -l myfile.txt\n\n\n\nawk 'FNR == 11 {print FILENAME, $0}' NAMEOFFILE.txt\n\nFNR : Line number you want to print\nprint FILENAME : built in awk variable that prints the file name (not needed but nice if you are printing lines from multiple files into a single log file).\n$0 : Tells awk to print the whole line.\nNAMEOFFILE.txt : The specific file you want to print\n\nExample\nPrint out the 11th line from a file.\nCommand\ndowney-wall.a@comp5[20190719_fastqc_trim_10bp_Cvirginica_MBD]# awk 'FNR == 11 {print FILENAME $0}' 17005*R1*.txt \nOutput\n17005_DNAm_R1.fastq.gz_trimming_report.txtAdapter sequence: 'CTGTCTCTTATA' (Nextera Transposase sequence; auto-detected)\nCode Extensions\nMultiple single lines with OR (|| operation)\nawk 'FNR==5 || FNR==9 {$0}' NAMEOFFILE.txt\nA range of lines with AND (&& operation)\nawk 'FNR >= 5 && FNR <= 10 {$0}' NAMEOFFILE.txt\nPrint from multiple files\nawk 'FNR==11 {$0}' *.txt\nSkipping lines\nawk 'NR % 2 {print} !(NR % 2) && /pattern/ {print}' FILENAME.txt\nCounting the columns\nawk -F'\\t' '{print NF; exit}' myfile.txt\n-F’\\t’ tells awk that your columns are tab delimited, you can switch this for another character depending on your dataset.

    "text": "Defiance has 72 (check) cores per comp node. Generally we like to leave a few available, so can parallelize code across up to 68 cores at once.\nFor genomics, we’re often doing tests for many loci. Depending on the test, it may be faster to run each locus in serial on a core, and spread out different parts of the data across several cores (as opposed to running each locus in serial across all cores in parallel).\nTo accomplish this, you will need a bash script and an R script. Examples are below.\nThe bash script takes in the total number of tests you want to do (number of loci or number of rows in a data frame, for instance), and then calculates how many should be run in serial on each core. It then runs through a loop. In each iteration of the loop (the total number of iterations should be equal to the number of cores), the bash script calls the R code and sends information about which rows in the dataframe are to be run in the R code. Each iteration of the loop calls R in the background on a different core.\nWithin the R code, another loop would be necessary to conduct the test for each row in the dataframe (not shown).\n\n\nSave this script as runRscripts.sh\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\nset -u\nset -o pipefail\n\n\n## Use these two lines of code if you have a conda environmnent you'd like to activate\n## and list what's in that environment\n# source activate msprime-env\n# conda list\n\nmypath=\"/XXX\" # set your path\n\ncd $mypath\n\nnrows=280000 # number of loci or rows to be tested.

Use VCF tools to do this: http://vcftools.sourceforge.net/\n\nfor minor alleles < 0.05 (if you have a lot of SNPs, or 0.01 if you don’t have a lot of SNPs)\nfor missing data at SNPs (keep SNPs in at least X% of individuals in all dataset)\nfor missing data at population level (keeps SNPs with calls in X% or higher of individuals per population)\nfor individuals with low SNP count (keep individuals with higher than X% of SNPs called)\nDepending on the context, X% might be 80% or might be 100%\n\nTo use the bigsnpr R package, you will have to change your data from the VCF format to a genotype matrix with 0/1/2 counts of the alternate allele. Transform from vcf to (plink to) raw. See the first steps in this tutorial.\nThe presence of LD can bias principal components. This paper explains the problem.

A good practice is to think about what parameters you are going to model and make a giant table. Here is an example for a simulation with three replicates of two different sets of parameters:\n\n\n\nSeed\nRep\nParam 1\nParam 2\n\n\n\n\n98234\n1\n0.5\n1.2\n\n\n98235\n2\n0.5\n1.2\n\n\n98236\n3\n0.5\n1.2\n\n\n98237\n1\n0.9\n1.5\n\n\n98238\n2\n0.9\n1.5\n\n\n98239\n3\n0.9\n1.5\n\n\n\nAs you loop through this table, you can use the Seed as the mySeed for your simulations. However, there are bad and good ways to take the seed from this table and incorporate it into your simulations.\n\nBad Practice:\nset.seed(mySeed)\na<-rnorm(100)\nset.seed(mySeed)\nb<-rnorm(100)\nset.seed(mySeed)\nc<-rnorm(100)\nTry this in R. What values do you get for a, b, and c?\n\n\nGood practice:\nset.seed(mySeed)\nsim_seeds <- round(runif(100)*10000000) \n  # may need more than 100 if there are more than \n  # 100 places in your sim where you set seeds\nset.seed(sim_seeds[1])\na<-rnorm(100)\nset.seed(sim_seeds[2])\nb<-rnorm(100)\nset.seed(sim_seeds[3])\nc<-rnorm(100)"

    "text": "VS Code and Pycharm are both Integrated Developement Environments, or IDEs. You’ve probably worked with an IDE, RStudio is an IDE. Ultimately the purpose of an IDE is to make coding easier. Some of the most basic features of IDEs are syntax highlighting and autocompletion capabilities, but they can also do a lot more than that - like displaying hover-over metadata (eg displaying a function’s documentation when hovering over code), jumping to the part of the file where a function is defined/used, showing where an error will occur, among others. While PyCharm is specifically built for python (but see other IDEs from jet brains), VS Code supports hundreds of coding languages.\nBoth PyCharm and VS Code have free professional versions for students and academics - see eg here for PyCharm. I won’t say much more about the purposes and cool features of these IDEs, for that it would be good to google, use the intro/how-to resources from each program’s page, or better yet open one up and explore.\nThe purpose of this post is to show how to set up VS Code and PyCharm to connect to NEU’s Discovery cluster.\n\nFirst download and install the program by visiting the landing pages linked above.\nMake sure you can ssh to discovery - in terminal ssh user@discovery.neu.edu\n\nTODO - link to example of ssh config\nto set up passwordless ssh so you don’t have to enter a password each time, see this link\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the Remote Development Extensionpack\n\n\n\nOnce the Remote Development Extension is installed, open the Command Palette (⇧⌘P) and type “Remote-SSH: Connect to Host…” and you should see something like this\n\n\n\nAfter a moment, VS Code will connect to the SSH server and set itself up. VS Code will keep you up-to-date using a progress notification. After you are connected, you’ll be in an empty window. You can always refer to the Status bar to see which host you are connected to.\n\n\n\nYou should now be able to choose the folder you wish to open\n\n\n\nAfter opening the folder destination you can begin to create new files or open that already exist\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter setting up a project first add the Remote Host tool window to the sidebar\n\n\n\nIf PyCharm opens the Remote Host tool window like a browser tab, you can drag it to the sidebar. Afterwards, click on it. Then click on the ... next to the drop down menu. In the Deployment window, click the + button to add a new SFTP connection. This will then prompt you to give a server name, let’s use “discovery”.\n\n\n\nNext we need to set up the SSH Configuration - click the ... next to the SSH Configuration drop-down menu. Fill in your credentials. I have passwordless ssh already configured (how-to link above) so I have selected to authenticate using my RSA key. Make sure to test the connection.\n\n\n\nClose the SSH Configuration window to return to the Deployment window. Test the connection in the Deployment window. After a successful connection, close the Deployment window and select ‘discovery’ from the Remote Host drop-down menu. You should now be able to browse files on the remote server."

    "text": "The protocol for doing a magnetic bead wash\n\n\n\nMagnetic beads are used for purification and size selection of single or double-stranded DNA. size selection may be performed at the following points during the overall library construction process:\n\nbefore or after DNA fragmentation;\nafter individual enzymatic reactions;\nafter the first post-ligation cleanup; or\nafter library amplification.\n\nWe use Kapa Pure Beads for magnetic bead washes. We find that they work as well as the Ampure Beads and are MUCH cheaper.\nBefore using, be sure to read the PDF from Kapa.\n\n\n\n\n\nClean up genomic DNA\nCleanup of fragmented DNA\nSize Selection\n\n\n\nFactors that Impact Overall Performance\n\n\n\n\nSee the PDF for the complete protocol. Tips:\n\n\n1.1 Ensure that KAPA Pure Beads has been equilibrated to room temperature and that the beads are fully resuspended before proceeding.\n1.2 Add 300 μL of KAPA Pure Beads (3:1 ratio for gDNA) to the 100 μL genomic DNA sample.\n1.3 Mix thoroughly by vortexing and/or pipetting up and down multiple times.\n1.4 Incubate the plate/tube(s) at room temperature for 10 min to bind the DNA to the beads.\n1.5 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture the beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear.\n1.6 Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.\n1.7 Keeping the plate/tube(s) on the magnet, add 200 μL of 80% ethanol.\n1.8 Incubate the plate/tube(s) on the magnet at room temperature for ≥30 sec.\n1.9 Carefully remove and discard the ethanol.\n1.10 Keeping the plate/tube(s) on the magnet, add 200 μL of 80% ethanol.\n1.11 Incubate the plate/tube(s) on the magnet at room temperature for ≥30 sec.\n1.12 Carefully remove and discard the ethanol. Try to remove all residual ethanol without disturbing the beads.\n1.13 Dry the beads at room temperature for 3 – 5 min, or until all of the ethanol has evaporated. Caution: over-drying the beads may result in reduced yield.\n1.14 Remove the plate/tube(s) from the magnet.\n1.15 Resuspend the beads in an appropriate volume of pre-heated elution buffer at 37°C and/or perform the elution incubation (step 1.16) in a thermocycler or heating block set to 37°C. The appropriate elution buffer may be either 10 mM Tris-HCl, (pH 8.0 – 8.5) or PCR-grade water, depending on the downstream application.\n1.16 Incubate the plate/tube(s) for 10 min to elute the DNA off the beads.\n1.17 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture the beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear.\n1.18 Transfer the clear supernatant to a new plate/ tube(s). Proceed with your downstream application, or store DNA at 4ºC for 1 – 2 weeks, or at -20ºC.\n\n\n\n\n3X KAPA Pure Beads to-sample volumetric ratio recommended\nThe detailed protocol below is an example of a 3X cleanup of genomic DNA in 100 µL. Please pay special attention to steps 1.15 and 1.16 (elution of DNA off beads). To ensure optimal recovery, these steps may be performed at an elevated temperature: 37°C for 10 min. Elution buffer may be pre-heated for this step and/or the elution performed in a thermocycler or heating block.\nAs indicated above, a heated elution is recommended to ensure optimal recovery of high-quality genomic DNA. This is not a requirement for the cleanup of other DNA types (e.g. fragmented DNA).\nFor maximum recovery of the original DNA sample during cleanup, buffer exchange, and/or concentration of genomic DNA, fragmented DNA for NGS library construction, PCR or qPCR products—regardless of quality—a KAPA Pure Beads-to-sample volumetric ratio of 3X is recommended. Expected recoveries are 50 – 90%, depending upon sample quality and quantity. If a lower ratio is used, it may result in lower yields and exclusion of smaller fragments.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1 Ensure that KAPA Pure Beads has been equilibrated to room temperature and that the beads are fully resuspended before proceeding.\n2.2 Add 80 μL of KAPA Pure Beads to the 100 μL fragmented DNA sample.\n2.3 Mix thoroughly by vortexing and/or pipetting up and down multiple times.\n2.4 Incubate the plate/tube(s) at room temperature for 5 – 15 min to bind the DNA to the beads.\n2.5 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture the beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear.\n2.6 Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.\n2.7 Keeping the plate/tube(s) on the magnet, add 200 μL of 80% ethanol.\n2.8 Incubate the plate/tube(s) on the magnet at room temperature for ≥30 sec.\n2.9 Carefully remove and discard the ethanol.\n2.10 Keeping the plate/tube(s) on the magnet, add 200 μL of 80% ethanol.\n2.11 Incubate the plate/tube(s) on the magnet at room temperature for ≥30 sec.\n2.12 Carefully remove and discard the ethanol. Try to remove all residual ethanol without disturbing the beads.\n2.13 Dry the beads at room temperature for 3 – 5 min, or until all of the ethanol has evaporated. Caution: over-drying the beads may result in reduced yield.\n2.14 Remove the plate/tube(s) from the magnet.\n2.15 Resuspend the beads in an appropriate volume of elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 – 8.5) or PCR-grade water, depending on the downstream application.\n2.16 Incubate the plate/tube(s) at room temperature for 2 min to elute the DNA off the beads. The elution time may be extended up to 10 min if necessary to improve DNA recovery.\n2.17 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture the beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear.\n2.18 Transfer the clear supernatant to a new plate/ tube(s). Proceed with your downstream application, or store DNA at 4ºC for 1 – 2 weeks, or at -20ºC.\n\n\n\n0.8X cleanup of a 100 µL fragmented DNA sample recommended (will retain fragments greater than 300 bp)\n\n\n\n\nFragments to be retained\nRecommended Beads-to-sample ratio\n\n\n\n\n≥ kb\n0.5X\n\n\n≥ 450 bp\n0.6X\n\n\n≥ 350 bp\n0.7X\n\n\n≥ 300 bp\n0.8X\n\n\n≥ 250 bp\n0.9X\n\n\n≥ 150 bp\n1.5X\n\n\n≥ 100 bp\n2.2X -3X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1 Ensure that KAPA Pure Beads has been equilibrated to room temperature and that the beads are fully resuspended before proceeding.\n3.2 Perform the first size cut (0.6X, to exclude large library fragments) by adding 30 μL of KAPA Pure Beads to 50 μL of adapter-ligated library (0.6 x 50 μL = 30 μL).\n3.3 Mix thoroughly by vortexing and/or pipetting up and down multiple times.\n3.4 Incubate the plate/tube(s) at room temperature for 5 – 15 min to bind large library molecules (>450 bp) to the beads.\n3.5 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture the beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear.\n3.6 Carefully transfer the supernatant containing the smaller library molecules (<450 bp) to a new plate/ tube(s). It is critical that no beads are transferred with the supernatant.\n3.7 Discard the plate/tube(s) containing the beads to which library fragments larger than ~450 bp are bound.\n3.8 Perform the second size cut (0.8X) by adding 10 μL of KAPA Pure Beads to the supernatant. This volume is calculated relative to the original sample volume of 50 μL, e.g., (0.8 – 0.6) x 50 μL = 10 μL.\n3.9 Mix thoroughly by vortexing and/or pipetting up and down multiple times.\n3.10 Incubate the plate/tube(s) at room temperature for 5 – 15 min to bind library molecules >250 bp to the beads.\n3.11 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture the beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant which contains library molecules smaller than\n\n250 bp.\n\n3.12 Keeping the plate/tube(s) on the magnet, add 200 μL of 80% ethanol.\n3.13 Incubate the plate/tube(s) on the magnet at room temperature for ≥30 sec.\n3.14 Carefully remove and discard the ethanol. 3.15 Keeping the plate/tube(s) on the magnet, add 200 μL of 80% ethanol.\n3.16 Incubate the plate/tube(s) on the magnet at room temperature for ≥30 sec.\n3.17 Carefully remove and discard the ethanol. Try to remove all residual ethanol without disturbing the beads.\n3.18 Dry the beads at room temperature for 3 – 5 min, or until all of the ethanol has evaporated. ⚠️ Caution: over-drying the beads may result in reduced yield.\n3.19 Remove the plate/tube(s) from the magnet.\n3.20 Thoroughly resuspend the beads in the required volume of elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 – 8.5), or PCR-grade water, depending on the downstream application.\n3.21 Incubate the plate/tube(s) at room temperature for 2 min to elute DNA off the beads. The elution time may be extended up to 10 min if necessary to improve DNA recovery.\n3.22 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture the beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear.\n3.23 Transfer the clear supernatant with size-selected DNA to a new plate/tube(s). Proceed with your downstream application, or store DNA at 4ºC for 1 – 2 weeks, or at -20ºC.\n\n\nBead-based size selection or “double-sided size selection” consists of a “first” and “second cut”, represented as ratios of beads-to-sample volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\nStore at 2°C to 8°C in a constant-temperature refrigerator; do not store at -20°C. Always ensure that KAPA Pure Beads is fully equilibrated to room temperature before use.\nFor optimal performance, always ensure that the KAPA Pure Beads is equilibrated to room temperature, that the beads are fully resuspended before use, and that the DNA and bead solutions are thoroughly mixed prior to the binding incubation.\nThe volumetric ratio of KAPA Pure Beads to sample is the critical factor in determining the size distribution of DNA fragments retained by the beads. The volume (ratio) may be modified/optimized based upon the specific application and/or point in the library construction workflow where a cleanup or size selection is employed.\nThe volume in which cleanups and size selection are performed may impact performance. DNA samples may be diluted in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 – 8.5) or PCR-grade water to increase the working volume prior to the addition of KAPA Pure Beads. This is recommended for starting volumes <50 µL, DNA preparations that are viscous, and/ or contain a high concentration of salts or PEG.\nIt is important to prepare fresh 80% ethanol prior to use, since ethanol absorbs atmospheric water.\nThe volume of 80% ethanol used for bead washes may be adjusted to accommodate different plate/tube volumes and/or limited pipetting capacity, but it is important that the beads are entirely submerged during the wash steps. Where possible, use a wash volume that is equal to the volume of sample plus KAPA Pure Beads.\nIt is important to remove all ethanol before proceeding with subsequent reactions. However, over-drying of beads may make them difficult to resuspend, and may result in a dramatic loss of DNA. Drying of beads for 3 – 5 min at room temperature should be sufficient. Drying of beads at 37ºC is not recommended.\nElution time and temperature may impact DNA recovery, particularly for high-molecular weight genomic DNA.\nPurified DNA in elution buffer should be stable at 4°C for 1 – 2 weeks, or for at least 1 month at -20°C. The long-term stability of library DNA at -20°C depends on a number of factors, including library concentration. Always use low DNA-binding tubes for long-term storage and avoid excessive freezing and thawing.\nTo increase the recovery of DNA at a specific stage in an NGS library construction protocol, the volume of KAPA Pure Beads used in the cleanup may be increased, but this will most likely result in the retention of smaller DNA fragments.\n\n\n\n\nIncrease upper size limit: Decrease the ratio of the first cut\nDecrease upper size limit: Increase the ratio of the first cut\n\n\n\n\n\nIncrease lower size limit: Decrease the ratio of the second cut\nDecrease lower size limit: Increase the ratio of the second cut\nThe second size cut should be performed with at least 0.2 volumes of KAPA Pure Beads. Please note the volume of the KAPA Pure Beads needed for the second cut is calculated relative to the volume of the sample at the start of the size selection procedure, not the volume of the DNA-containing supernatant transferred after the first cut. DNA recovery is dramatically reduced if the difference between the first and second cuts is less than ~0.2  volumes. To increase the amount of DNA recovered, more than 0.2 volumes of KAPA Pure Beads may be used for the second cut, but note that this may result in the recovery of smaller library fragments and a broader size distribution."

Select the correct logger\nIf the logger has an expired calibration, you will be promoted to calibrate the logger. If it isn’t expired, you should still calibrate before deploying by selecting ‘pH Calibration’\nThis will open a window with a very easy-to-follow guide on how to calibrate the logger. We typically do a three-point calibration, so choose ‘Three-Point’ Follow the important tips at the bottom of the page. Namely, make sure the copper tip has been removed before calibrating and make sure the temperature logger is fully submerged when calibrating\n\nTip: Have the logger in the 7 pH buffer before clicking ‘Start Calibration’ and before clikcing ‘Next Buffer’ for the 4 and 10 pH buffers\nIf you put it in the wrong buffer or click ‘Next Buffer’ before putting the logger in, you should be able to place the logger in the buffer and it will properly stabilize\n\n\n\nAfter the logger has been calibrated you can configure it and launch it. To do so:\n\nChoose ‘Configure’ under the ‘Actions’ list\nSome things I would change: Name (to something meaningful like 20180615_Barnstable_pH), Logging Interval (typically 30 min), Start Logging (to the date and time it will be deployed, or ‘Now’ if relaunching), Stop Logging (make sure it’s on ‘When memory fills’), and make sure bluetooth is always on.\nClick ‘Start’ and the logger should launch at the date and time you set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinderblock\nMetal tubing straps to attach PVC fixed loggers to\nZipties\nPVC pipe large and long enough to fit logger, “swiss-cheesed’ with holes There must be enough holes for regular flow of water through the PVC pipe. The PVC pipe prevents large rocks and debris from damaging loggers\nRope and buoy\nGlass bottles and 50 mL Falcon tubes. See this page for water sampling protocol\n\n\n\n\n\nAttach metal straps to cinder block\nAttach PVC pipe to the metal rings that are fastened to the cinderblock\nLabel cinderblock, PVC pipe, buoy, and loggers with contact information (Katie’s)\nMake sure you’ve contacted local shellfish constable to make sure they can keep an eye on the logger\n\n\n\n\nLoggers should be deployed at low tide, so that we know they’ll be constantly exposed to water while logging\n\nBefore deploying, attach logger(s) to PVC using many zipties IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE THE COPPER GUARD HAS BEEN PLACED ON SENSOR BEFORE DEPLOYING\nWade to waist-deep water at site of deployment\nDeploy logger\nRecord time of deployment. If loggers start logging before they are deployed they give strange readings. It is good to know when the logger was actually deployed, so we know when logging was actually initiated\nRecord location using GPS\nTake water samples\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the geographic location, deployment time, and additional notes about site to the log file (should be a google doc- ask Katie)\nMake sure field sample in glass bottle has been poisoned with Mecuric Chloride (Ries Lab) and place in freezer\n\n\n\n\n\nData from loggers should be off-loaded about every two weeks\n\n\n\nGlass bottle and 50mL Falcon tube fore water samples\nIPad with HOBO software\nKimwipes\nWire cutters (to clip zipties)\nZipties- to reattached logger\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieve logger and record the time you collected logger\n\npH protocols is not finished"

    "text": "Determining Barcodes and Indexes for Illumina Sequencing\nEdit this page\nTips for determining barcodes and indexes for Illumina Sequencing\n\nFirst, you should make a plan for the adapters that you are going to use for each sample. As you choose adapters, you want to ensure that there is not low diversity in the indexes or in the first 5-6 bases of every read. Low diversity can result in high error rates because of an unbalanced color scheme as explained here by Illumina:\nIllumina Low Plex Pooling Guidelines\nThe term “nucleotide diversity” describes the proportion of each nucleotide (A, T, C, and G) at each position in a sequencing library. A “balanced” or “diverse” library has equal proportions of A, C, G, and T nucleotides at each base position in a sequencing library. In particular, nucleotide diversity is key during the first 4–7 cycles of Read 1 for all Illumina sequencing systems. The sequencing software uses images from these early cycles to identify the location of each cluster in a process called template generation. This results in overclustering. Overclustering creates image analysis problems, including loss of focus, poor template generation, and issues with cluster registration. The increased overall signal brightness of the flow cell makes it difficult for the sequencer to read and find the appropriate focal plane.\nIllumina Consequences of Overclustering\nNext, and especially if you are doing library prep for the first time, I suggest that you draw out what is happening to the DNA or RNA at every step of the process:\nExample Genomic Library Prep with p5 inline barcode and index in p7 PCR Primer\nExample Library prep with inline barcodes and dual indexes\nFor genomic DNA library prep, we are now working with inline barcodes on the P5 (left) adapter and indexes on the P7 (right) adapter. See above figure for details (note: KEL thinks there is issues with this system and this may change). These can give up to 12*12 = 144 unique barcodes. But, keep in mind that every sample can’t have the same barcode (e.g., can’t have 12 samples with 1 barcode and 12 indexes), and every sample can’t have the same index (e.g., can’t have 12 samples with 12 barcodes and 1 index) because of the low-diversity problem.\nAlso, note that the indexes will also demultiplex with Illumina’s software at the sequencing facility. But after you receive them, the reads will need to be further demultiplexed using the inline barcodes with a program such as STACKS.\nLotterhos adapter and primer database\nLotterhos y-adapters with inline barcodes and dual indexes"

    "text": "The protocol for checking quantification of DNA using the PicoGreen Assay on the Plate Reader\n\n\n\nPicoGreen dsDNA Quantitation Reagent is an ultra-sensitive fluorescent nucleic acid stain for quantitating double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in molecular biological procedures such as cDNA synthesis for library production and DNA fragment purification for subcloning, as well as diagnostic applications, such as quantitating DNA amplification products and primer extension assays. The most commonly used technique for measuring nucleic acid concentration is the determination of absorbance at 260 nm (A260).\n\n\n\n\nflat bottom black Costar 96-well plate (Fisher Cat #: 07-200-627) (FIND OUT IF AUTOCLAVE SAFE)\ntwo - 15 mL Falcon tubes\ntwo - 0.2 mL snap cap tubes for ladder dilutions\nsamples diluted to appropriate concentration to be read on the plate reader\n20X TE Buffer (comes with PicoGreen Kit)\nPicoGreen Dye (comes with PicoGreen Kit)\nDNA Ladder 100 ug/mL (comes with PicoGreen Kit)\nSynergy HTX plate reader in shared molecular space\n\n\n\n\n\nPlate reader can read samples between 25 pg/mL - 1,000 ng/mL (or 0.000025 - 1 ng/uL). To be conservative we make the highest concentration for our ladder 500 ng/mL.\nSamples should be diluted to be read within this range. For example, typical quantifications for Atlantic cod DNA extractions using a spin column plate is between 10 - 200 ng/uL. Therefore, you should do a 1:10 dilution because the reaction does a 1:100 dilution in the reaction itself. This brings the final DNA concentration to 10 - 200 ng/mL which is well within the range of the assay.\nPicoGreen dye is a solid when stored at 4C. Allow the dye to come to room temperature before use. Take out the kit and leave on the counter before starting protocol to ensure it becomes a liquid. You can pipette TE and samples while it is coming to room temp.\nThe first column of your plate needs to be saved for the ladder standards. Therefore if you are using 6 standards as recommended in this protocol, the most samples you could run on a plate is 90.\n\n\n\n\n\nDilute your 20X TE to 1X TE by pipetting 9.5 mL of Molecular Grade H2O and 0.5 mL of 20X TE into a 15mL falcon tube. This solution is stable long term so you can make more than you will need and store for later use. If you will not be using frequently, you can also calculate exactly how much you need and just make enough for that use.\nCreate your ladder standards using Table 1. The stock ladder is at 100 ug/mL. So for example, to make Dilution 1 at 2 ug/mL, combine 1 uL of stock ladder with 49 uL of 1X TE.\nPipette 49 uL of 1X TE in all sample wells and the appropriate volume of 1X TE into each standard well according to Table 2. For example for standard 1 pipette 25 uL of 1X TE in the appropriate well.\nAdd 1 uL of sample to each of the sample wells and the appropriate amount of each ladder to the standard wells according to Table 2. For example, add 25 uL of Ladder Dilution 1 to standard 1 well.\nAt this point your PicoGreen should be at room temperature. Create your Diluted PicoGreen and use Equation 1 to determine how much stock PicoGreen dye you need for the number of samples/standards you are running. Then use that value to calculate the amount of 1X TE this should be added to for a 200 times dilution using Equation 2.\nPipette diluted PicoGreen to each well with each well getting 50 uL of the 200 times diluted PicoGreen. When adding the diluted PicoGreen pipette up and down at least 20 times to mix sample, TE and PicoGreen together.\nUse a plate cover and briefly spin down the plate to get all liquid to the bottom of the well.\nRun plate on a Plate Reader using the Gen5 software. First turn on the machine to warm up (takes ~2-3 minutes)\nOpen Gen5 software and on the opening window make sure you are on the “Run Now” option on the left side column and click on the PicoGreen Assay full plate file.\nThis will open another window with a full plate already loaded just click “cancel”\nClick “Plate Layout” on the top bar which will open a new window to edit with your standard curve and sample wells\nClear plate by highlighting “EMPTY” on the left panel and click and drag across whole plate\nThen right click on the “STD” and click “edit” to change your standard curve values to what you set up for your plate when you are done editing click okay\nHighlight the first standard curve value in the left panel and click on the appropriate well where that value is located. You can click and drag down the column if they are all in a row.\nHighlight the first sample (SP1) from the left panel and click on the well with your first sample well and drag across the plate until all wells you want readings for are filled. ** You do not need to put water in empty wells can just leave empty **\nWhen this is done click okay and the machine will have a bulb warm up period after which it will ask you to load your plate. You do not need to close the drawer it will close automatically after you load the plate and click “okay”.\nThe run should take ~2-3 minutes, then click on the “Statistics” tab and output that spreadsheet to an excel file by copy and pasting.\nFinally use XXX spreadsheet to convert absorbance values to associated concentrations.\n\n\n\n(1.1 * (50 uL diluted PicoGreen * (#samples + #standards))/200 = vol of Stock PicoGreen\n\n\n\n199 * vol of Stock PicoGreen = vol of 1x TE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLadder Type\nConcentration (ug/mL)\nLadder Type\nLadder Vol (uL)\n1X TE Vol (uL)\n\n\n\n\nD1\n2\nStock\n1\n49\n\n\nD2\n0.2\nD1\n1\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandards\nConcentration (ng/mL)\nLadder Type\nLadder Vol (uL)\n1X TE Vol (uL)\nDiluted PicoGreen Vol (uL)\n\n\n\n\n1\n500\nD1\n25\n25\n50\n\n\n2\n250\nD1\n12.5\n37.5\n50\n\n\n3\n100\nD1\n5\n45\n50\n\n\n4\n10\nD2\n5\n45\n50\n\n\n5\n4\nD2\n2\n48\n50\n\n\nblank\n0\n-\n-\n50\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReagent\nVolume (uL)\n\n\n\n\n1X TE\n49\n\n\nsample\n1\n\n\ndil PG\n50"
