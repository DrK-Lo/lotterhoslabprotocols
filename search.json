    "title": "How to color code your terminal",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Edit this page\nOften when we use terminal, we’ll use ls to list the files in the current directory. It can be useful to have different types of files be colored different colors so you can more easily make sense of what is output.\nIn this tutorial, we’ll create a dummy folder and put some files with various suffixes. Then we’ll add the BASH code to color the files. You’ll have to set this up for each computer/server that you use.\nNext, we’ll color code the prompt (the part that says the computer and folder at the beginning of the command line in terminal).\n\n\n\n\nWe want to create a dummy folder just to practice setting up the color coding, then you can delete the dummy folder later.\nLet’s create a dummy folder in your home directory: mkdir ~/dummy\nThen change to that directory: cd ~/dummy\nNow let’s create some files:\n\ntouch dummy.txt\ntouch dummy.out\ntouch dummy.R\ntouch dummy.py\ntouch dummy.sh\ntouch dummy.RDS\ntouch dummy.md5\ntouch dummy.tar\ntouch dummy.png\n\n\n\n\nThe way BASH ‘knows’ what color to color-code the files is through an environmental variable called LS_COLORS. We show LS_COLORS to BASH by ‘export’-ing it like so:\nexport LS_COLORS=\"*RDS=01;35\"\nNow if you ls your dummy folder the RDS file should show up as purple. Note the asterisk, this tells BASH that any text can preceed the ‘RDS’ end of the file.\nThe pattern for file colors is pretty simple, the first number (eg 01) references whether or not to bold the color (01 is bold, 00 is non-bold). The second number is the color (35 is magenta). Here are some more colors for future reference:\n\nBlack: 30 (note making black bold will be more of a gray color)\nRed: 31 (red is generally the default color for compressed files (eg .tar, .tar.gz\nGreen: 32\nYellow: 33\nBlue: 34 (note bold blue is generally the default color for folders, you may not want to set anything to this color)\nMagenta: 35\nCyan: 36\nWhite: 37 (default for all files)\nGray: 90\nLight red: 91\nLight green: 92\n\nLight yello: 93 Light yellow\nLight blue: 94\nLight magenta: 95\nLight cyan: 96\n\nWhen you want to have LS_COLORS handle multiple file colors, you separate each of the bits with a colon (:). So if we wanted any file that ends with ‘out’ to be gray but keep the RDS we do this:\nexport LS_COLORS=\"*RDS=01;35:*out=01;30\"\nNow if you ls the directory the RDS and .out files will be colored. Here is the export I use:\nexport LS_COLORS=\"rs=0:di=01;34:ln=01;36:mh=00:pi=40;33:so=00;35:do=00;35:bd=40;33;01:cd=40;33;01:or=40;31;01:mi=01;05;37;41:su=37;41:sg=30;43:ca=30;41:tw=30;42:ow=34;42:st=37;44:ex=01;32:*.tar=01;31:*.tgz=01;31:*.arc=01;31:*.arj=01;31:*.taz=01;31:*.lha=01;31:*.lz4=01;31:*.lzh=01;31:*.lzma=01;31:*.tlz=01;31:*.txz=01;31:*.tzo=01;31:*.t7z=01;31:*.zip=01;31:*.z=01;31:*.Z=01;31:*.dz=01;31:*.gz=01;31:*.lrz=01;31:*.lz=01;31:*.lzo=01;31:*.xz=01;31:*.bz2=01;31:*.bz=01;31:*.tbz=01;31:*.tbz2=01;31:*.tz=01;31:*.deb=01;31:*.rpm=01;31:*.jar=01;31:*.war=01;31:*.ear=01;31:*.sar=01;31:*.rar=01;31:*.alz=01;31:*.ace=01;31:*.zoo=01;31:*.cpio=01;31:*.7z=01;31:*.rz=01;31:*.cab=01;31:*.jpg=00;35:*.jpeg=00;35:*.gif=00;35:*.bmp=00;35:*.pbm=00;35:*.pgm=00;35:*.ppm=00;35:*.tga=00;35:*.xbm=00;35:*.xpm=00;35:*.tif=00;35:*.tiff=00;35:*.png=00;35:*.svg=00;35:*.svgz=00;35:*.mng=00;35:*.pcx=00;35:*.mov=00;35:*.mpg=00;35:*.mpeg=00;35:*.m2v=00;35:*.mkv=00;35:*.webm=00;35:*.ogm=00;35:*.mp4=00;35:*.m4v=00;35:*.mp4v=00;35:*.vob=00;35:*.qt=00;35:*.nuv=00;35:*.wmv=00;35:*.asf=00;35:*.rm=00;35:*.rmvb=00;35:*.flc=00;35:*.avi=00;35:*.fli=00;35:*.flv=00;35:*.gl=00;35:*.dl=00;35:*.xcf=00;35:*.xwd=00;35:*.yuv=00;35:*.cgm=00;35:*.emf=00;35:*.axv=00;35:*.anx=00;35:*.ogv=00;35:*.ogx=00;35:*.aac=01;36:*.au=01;36:*.flac=01;36:*.mid=01;36:*.midi=01;36:*.mka=01;36:*.mp3=01;36:*.mpc=01;36:*.ogg=01;36:*.ra=01;36:*.wav=01;36:*.axa=01;36:*.oga=01;36:*.spx=01;36:*.xspf=01;36:*pkl=01;35:*R=00;32:*py=00;32:*sh=00;32:*out=01;30:*md5=01;36:*RDS=01;35\"\nIf you want to have these colors show up every time you start a new terminal session, you can put them in your bashrc file that is sourced each time you open a new session (i.e., open a new terminal window or ssh).\nTo edit the bashrc file do this: vim ~/.bashrc. If you scroll you should see a section that says something like “# User specific aliases and functions”, add the export command below this line: hit i to insert text and the normal paste command (command + v on a mac). Then to “write + quit” to save the file first hit esc then :wq (note colon) and then hit enter. You’ll need to start a new terminal session or source ~/.bashrc for the export command to be executed.\nYou will also need to add this command to your .bashrc to show colors: alias ls=\"ls --color=always\". This will make it so that whenever you do ls, the full command ls --color=always is executed instead.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s useful to color code this prompt (see below) so that it’s easy to tell which computer/server you’re working on. This part of the prompt has the environmental name PS1. For instance, I color code my personal computer’s PS1 as bold white, and several other servers different colors so that I can quickly know where I am. (ignore the “(py3)” “(mvp_env)” etc before the color coding, that’s just my anaconda environment)\n\nAs above with LS_COLORS we can use bold/unbold and the color of our choice. For instance, here is my PS1 for the discovery cluster. This will display the hostname of the computer/server (\\h) and the basename of the current working directory (\\W) in bold blue (01;34m) that ends in a dollar sign $:\nexport PS1='\\[\\e[01;34m\\][\\h \\W]\\$\\[\\e[0m\\] '\nThere are other variables like \\h or \\W you can add, like the current time with AM/PM (\\@) the full path to the current working directory (\\w), and others. Just google “bash PS1” and you’ll find some other examples.\nAs with LS_COLORS if you want this to export every time you connect to the host, put the export command in your ~/.bashrc.",

    "text": "Edit this page\n\n\n\nI think taking 6308 + 6200 would be the best for new students, and if you had to pick one, 6308 is probably easier and will give students more bioinfo exposure. 6200 is much harder, has much more comp sci theory/programming in it, and for someone who has never seen a fastq or bam file.. it might be a steeper learning curve.\n\n\n\nFocuses on the fundamental programming skills required in the bioinformatics industry. Focuses on Python and R as the main programming language used. Topics include string operations, file manipulation, regular expressions, object-oriented programming, data structures, testing, program design, and implementation. Includes substantial out-of-classroom assignments.\n\n\n\n\nOffers the first semester of a two-semester sequence on the use of computers in bioinformatics research. Offers students an opportunity to work with current methods and computational algorithms used in contemporary sequence analysis. Teaches practical skills necessary to manage and mine the vast biological information being generated and housed in public databases. Emphasizes the use of Python as the primary computer language and requires students to learn and understand basic computer logic and syntax, including an introduction to scalars, arrays, hashes, decision statements, loops, subroutines, references, and regular expressions. A focus on fundamental skills, including the command line interface found in the Linux operating system, is designed to prepare students for second-semester applications.\n\n\n\n\nSyllabus:\n\nDesigned to build upon the core topics covered in BINF 6308, i.e., use of the computer as a tool for bioinformatics research. Builds upon the Python language fundamentals covered during the first semester but requires students to apply these fundamentals to a semester-long project. The project includes protein family analysis, multiple sequence analysis, phylogeny, and protein structure analysis. Additionally, students have an opportunity to learn to build, load, connect, and query custom MySQL databases, and parse command line flags.\n\n\n\n\nSyllabus:\n\nIntroduces the field of genomics. With the completion of the Human Genome Project several years ago, there has been an explosion of genetic data collected. Focuses on the bioinformatics tools necessary to analyze large-scale genomic data. Covers topics such as phylogenetic trees, molecular evolution, gene expression profiling, heterogeneous genomic data, as well as next-generation sequencing (NGS) data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSyllabus:\n\n\nThis course is an accelerated introduction to the principles of systematic problem solving through “computational thinking” and programming. Topics include analysis of problems, modeling a solution, data types, and control structures. Additionally, it will introduce various ways to organize data including a discussion of their advantages and disadvantages.\nThis course is part of the ALIGN MS in the Computer Science Program, but assumes no prior experience with programming. Students learn the basics of programming using the Python programming language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSyllabus: https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/alina/classes/Spring2021/\n\nMachine learning is a fast-pacing and exciting field achieving human-level performance in tasks such as image classification, speech recognition. machine translation, precision medicine, and self-driving cars. Machine learning has already impacted greatly our daily lives and has the potential to transform the world even more in the near future. This course will provide a broad introduction to machine learning and cover the fundamental algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning. We will cover topics related to regression, classification, deep learning, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. The class will also provide an introduction into adversarial machine learning, an emerging area that studies the fundamental security issues of machine learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffers an overview of traditional and modern statistical methods used to analyze biological data using the free and open-source R programming environment. Lectures describe core statistical approaches and discuss their suitability for understanding patterns that arise at different levels of biological organization, from cellular processes to whole ecosystems. Supervised lab sessions offer students an opportunity to develop the R programming skills required to analyze the complex datasets that often emerge when addressing cutting-edge questions in biology. Topics include basic probability and sampling theory, experimental design, null hypothesis significance testing, t-tests and ANOVA, correlation and regression, likelihood, model selection, and information theory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscusses history of evolutionary theory and lines of evidence. Emphasis is on mechanisms of speciation. Introduces and discusses current evolutionary topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course explores the practical application of GIS to support geographic inquiry and decision making. It focuses on the technical knowledge of the common tasks that a GIS analyst faces in applying GIS to a variety of spatial problems. Students will gain hands-on experience with a leading commercial GIS software package.Students will have the opportunity to gain a good understanding of the concepts, principles, approaches, and techniques of spatial analysis using Geographic Information Systems.\n\nStudents will have the opportunity to become familiar with the everyday challenges facing GIS professionals as they apply GIS principles to a variety of spatial problems.\nStudents will have the opportunity to gain an understanding of real-world GIS applications and how to approach them.\nStudents will have the opportunity to explore geographic data, to learn how it is stored and managed, and to see how it differs from other types of data.\nStudents will have the opportunity to become familiar with the basic functionality and operation of the ESRI ArcGIS software.",

Larger pieces of tissue, very hard or fibrous tissues, and tissues with a high RNase content must typically be ground to a powder in liquid nitrogen for maximum RNA yield.\nHomogenizing tissue: Homogenize samples in 10–20 volumes TRI Reagent solution (e.g., 1 mL TRI Reagent solution per 50–100mg tissue), using standard homogenization procedures.\n\nThe sample volume should not exceed 10% of the volume of TRI Reagent solution used for homogenization.\n\n\nIncubate the homogenate for 5 min at room temp.\n\nThis 5 min room temperature incubation allows nucleoprotein complexes to completely dissociate.\nHomogenized samples can be stored at –70°C for at least one month.\n\n(Optional) Centrifuge at 12,000 xg for 10 min at 4°C and transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube.\n\nThis optional centrifugation is only required to remove insoluable material from homogenates that contain high amounts of protein, fat, polysaccharide, or extracellular material, such as muscle, fat tissue, and tuberous parts of plants. Centrifugation pellets, extracellular membranes, polysaccharides, and high molecular weight DNA, leaving the RNA in the supernatant. High molecular weight DNA can be recovered from the pellet by following the wash and solubilization steps of the DNA isolation protocol, available here\n\nAdd 100 μL BCP per 1 mL of TRI Reagent solution, mix well, and incubate at room temp for 5–15 min.\n\nAdd 100 μL BCP per 1 mL of TRI Reagent solution used for homogenization. Alternatively, 200 μL of chloroform (without isoamyl alcohol) can be used in place of BCP.\nCap the tubes tightly and shake vigorously for 15sec.\nIncubate the mixture at room temperature for 5–15 min.\n\nCentrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10–15 min at 4°C, then transfer the aqueous phase to a fresh tube.\n\nCentrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10–15 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the aqueous phase (colorless top layer) to a fresh tube.\nRNA remains exclusively in the aqueous phase whereas DNA and protein are in the interphase and organic phase.\nThe interphase and lower, red, organic phase can be stored at 4°C for subsequent isolation of DNA and protein. A protocol is posted here\n\nAdd 500 μL of isopropanol per 1 mL of TRI Reagent solution, vortex for 5–10 sec, and incubate at room temp for 5–10 min.\n\nAdd 500 μL of isopropanol per 1 mL of TRI Reagent solution used for sample homogenization.\nVortex at moderate speed for 5–10 sec.\nIncubate the samples at room temp for 5–10 min.\nNote For oysters, we use a modified protocol:\n\nTransfer the aqueous phase from step 5 to a fresh tube. For each 1 mL of TRI Reagent solution used for the homogenization, add 250 μL of isopropanol and 250 μL of a high salt precipitation solution (e.g. 0.8 M sodium citrate and 1.2 M NaCl).\nMix well, store for 5–10 min at room temperature, and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 8 min at 4–25°C.\nWash the resulting RNA pellet as described in steps 8 and 9 of the procedure.\n\n\nCentrifuge at 12,000 x g for 8 min at 4–25°C, and discard the supernatant.\n\nCentrifuge at 12,000 x g for 8 min at 4–25°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\n\nPrecipitated RNA forms a gel-like or white pellet on the side and bottom of the tube.\n\n\nAdd 1 mL of 75% ethanol per 1 mL of TRI Reagent solution.\n\nAdd 1 mL of 75% ethanol per 1 mL TRI Reagent solution used for sample homogenization to each sample to wash the RNA pellets.\n\nCentrifuge at 7,500 x g for 5 min, remove the ethanol, and briefly air dry the RNA pellet.\n\nCentrifuge at 7,500 x g for 5 min at 4–25°C.\n\nIf the precipitated RNA floats or does not form a compact pellet, repeat the centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 5 min to consolidate the pellet at the bottom of the tube.\n\nRemove the ethanol wash without disturbing the pellet.\nRemove all residual ethanol by centrifuging again briefly and removing the ethanol that collects with a fine tip pipette. Complete removal of ethanol is necessary for the RNA to perform well in downstream applications.\nAir dry the RNA pellet for 3–5min.\n\nDo not completely dry the RNA pellet as this will greatly decrease its solubility. Do not dry RNA by vacuum centrifugation. 10.Dissolve RNA in the buffer of your choice.\n\nDissolve RNA in THE RNA Storage Solution (P/N AM7000, AM7001), Nuclease-free Water, or your choice of buffer‡ by passing the solution a few times through a pipette tip or by vigorous vortexing\nThe resuspension volume is determined by the size of the RNA pellet. 3–5 mm pellets typically require 300–500 μL. If necessary, increase the resuspension volume or incubate at 55–60°C to completely dissolve the pellet.\nStore at 4°C for immediate analysis. For long-term storage, store at –70°C or colder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRNAeasy kit purification of total RNA from small amounts of starting material\nMolecular grade EtOH\n\n\n\n\n\nTissue homogenizer with replacable probes (Jon can you add specs of ours here)\nMicro centrifuge &gt; 8,000 rpm\n\n\n\n\n\nIf purifying RNA from cell lines rich in RNases, or tissue, add either 10 μl β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), or 20 μl 2 M dithiothreitol (DTT)*, to 1 ml Buffer RLT. Buffer RLT with β-ME or DTT can be stored at room temperature for up to 1 month.\nAdd 4 volumes of ethanol (96–100%) to Buffer RPE for a working solution.\nRemove RNAlater®-stabilized tissue from the reagent using forceps.\n\n\nDo not use more than 30 mg tissue. Disrupt the tissue and homogenize the lysate in the appropriate volume of Buffer RLT (350 μl for less than 20 mg; 650 μl for less than 30 mg). Centrifuge the lysate for 3 min at maximum speed. Carefully remove the supernatant by pipetting, and use it in step 2.\nAdd 1 volume of 70% ethanol to the lysate, and mix well by pipetting. Do not centrifuge. Proceed immediately to step 3.\nTransfer up to 700 μl of the sample, including any precipitate, to an RNeasy Mini spin column placed in a 2 ml collection tube (supplied). Close the lid, and centrifuge for 15 s at ≥8000 x g. Discard the flow-through.\nAdd 700 μl Buffer RW1 to the RNeasy spin column. Close the lid, and centrifuge for 15 s at ≥8000 x g.

Discard the flow-through.\nAdd 500 μl Buffer RPE to the RNeasy spin column. Close the lid, and centrifuge for 2 min at ≥8000 x g.\nOptional: Place the RNeasy spin column in a new 2 ml collection tube (supplied). Centrifuge at full speed for 1 min to dry the membrane.\nPlace the RNeasy spin column in a new 1.5 ml collection tube (supplied). Add 30–50 μl RNase-free water directly to the spin column membrane. Close the lid, and centrifuge for 1 min at ≥8000 x g to elute the RNA.\nIf the expected RNA yield is &gt;30 μg, repeat step 7 using another 30–50 μl of RNase-free water, or using the eluate from step 7 (if high RNA concentration is required).

Larger pieces of tissue, very hard or fibrous tissues, and tissues with a high RNase content must typically be ground to a powder in liquid nitrogen for maximum RNA yield.\nHomogenizing tissue: Homogenize samples in 10–20 volumes TRI Reagent solution (e.g., 1 mL TRI Reagent solution per 50–100mg tissue), using standard homogenization procedures.\n\nThe sample volume should not exceed 10% of the volume of TRI Reagent solution used for homogenization.\n\n\nIncubate the homogenate for 5 min at room temp.\n\nThis 5 min room temperature incubation allows nucleoprotein complexes to completely dissociate.\nHomogenized samples can be stored at –70°C for at least one month.\n\n(Optional) Centrifuge at 12,000 xg for 10 min at 4°C and transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube.\n\nThis optional centrifugation is only required to remove insoluable material from homogenates that contain high amounts of protein, fat, polysaccharide, or extracellular material, such as muscle, fat tissue, and tuberous parts of plants. Centrifugation pellets, extracellular membranes, polysaccharides, and high molecular weight DNA, leaving the RNA in the supernatant.

Complete removal of ethanol is necessary for the RNA to perform well in downstream applications.\nAir dry the RNA pellet for 3–5min.\n\nDo not completely dry the RNA pellet as this will greatly decrease its solubility. Do not dry RNA by vacuum centrifugation. 10.Dissolve RNA in the buffer of your choice.\n\nDissolve RNA in THE RNA Storage Solution (P/N AM7000, AM7001), Nuclease-free Water, or your choice of buffer‡ by passing the solution a few times through a pipette tip or by vigorous vortexing\nThe resuspension volume is determined by the size of the RNA pellet. 3–5 mm pellets typically require 300–500 μL. If necessary, increase the resuspension volume or incubate at 55–60°C to completely dissolve the pellet.\nStore at 4°C for immediate analysis. For long-term storage, store at –70°C or colder.",

The adapter container the appropriate sequence necessary for successful downstream PCR amplification. The hexamer overhang in the original protocol (Raines et al. 2016) was a randomly generated hexamer (NNNNNN) that would bind with complimentary 6 base ends (both the 3’ and 5’ end of the ssDNA). This works, but is likely highly inefficient. With a ddRAD protocol, known 3’ and 5’ end sequences are produced. We take advantage of this by designing hexamers that will specifically target these sequences. However, for this to work special care is needed"

    "text": "4. Bisulfite PCR\nKAPA HiFi HotStart is a novel B-family DNA polymerase, engineered to have increased affinity for DNA, without the need for accessory proteins or DNA-binding domains. The intrinsic high processivity of the enzyme results in significant improvement in yield, speed and sensitivity when compared with wild-type B-family DNA polymerases and polymerase blends. When used for the amplification of next-generation sequencing (NGS) libraries, KAPA HiFi HotStart DNA Polymerase exhibits high yields with minimal amplification bias and provides extremely uniform sequence coverage.\nThe read-ahead function of proofreading DNA polymerases detects pro-mutagenic uracil residues in the template strand and prevents further strand extension, thereby reducing or completely inhibiting PCR amplification. In KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ DNA Polymerase, this uracilbinding pocket is inactivated to enable the amplification of uracil-containing DNA. The enzyme shows the same high yield, low GC-bias and coverage uniformity as the unmodified KAPA HiFi HotStart DNA Polymerase, making it particularly advantageous for applications employing bisulfite DNA conversion, which typically produces low concentrations of AT-rich DNA.\nKAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ DNA Polymerase has 5’g3’ polymerase and 3’g5’ exonuclease (proofreading) activity, but no 5’g3’ exonuclease activity. The strong 3’g5’ exonuclease activity results in superior accuracy during DNA amplification. A proprietary antibody inactivates the polymerase until the first cycle of denaturation, minimizing spurious amplification products that may result from nonspecific priming events during reaction setup and initiation, and increasing overall reaction efficiency. KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ ReadyMix (2X) is a ready-touse cocktail containing all components required for PCR, except primers and template. The ReadyMix contains 0.2 mM of each dNTP (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP), and does not contain dUTP."

Mix, then centrifuge briefly to ensure there are no droplets in the cap or sides of the tube.\nNote: If the volumne of DNA is less than 20uL, compensate with water.\nPlace the PCR tube in a thermal cycler and perform the following steps:\n\n\n\nTemp\nTime\n\n\n\n\n98oC\n8 minutes\n\n\n54oC\n60 minutes\n\n\n4oC\nup to 20 hours\n\n\n\n\nSTOPPING POINT: If you cannot proceed with desalting and desulfonation immediately, you can store the converted sample at -20oC for up to 2 hours. Thaw the samples at room temp, then proceed with desalting and desulfonation.\n\n\nAdd 600 μl of M-Binding Buffer to a Zymo-Spin™ IC Column and place the column into a provided Collection Tube.\nLoad the sample (from Step 2) into the Zymo-Spin™ IC Column containing the M-Binding Buffer. Close the cap and mix by inverting the column several times.\nCentrifuge at full speed (&gt; 10,000 x g) for 30 seconds. Discard the flow-through.\nAdd 100 μl of M-Wash Buffer to the column. Centrifuge at full speed for 30 seconds.\nAdd 200 μl of L-Desulphonation Buffer to the column and let stand at room temperature (20-30°C) for 15-20 minutes. After the incubation, centrifuge at full speed for 30 seconds.\nAdd 200 μl of M-Wash Buffer to the column. Centrifuge at full speed for 30 seconds. Repeat this wash step.\nPlace the column into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and add 10 μl of M-Elution Buffer directly to the column matrix. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at full speed to elute the DNA.\n\nThe DNA is ready for immediate analysis or can be stored at or below -20°C for later use. For long term storage, store at or below -70°C. We recommend using 1-4 μl of eluted DNA for each PCR, however, up to 10 μl can be used if necessary. The elution volume can be &gt; 10 μl depending on the requirements of your experiments, but small elution volumes will yield higher DNA concentrations.\n\n\nAssess the yield and quality of the bisulfite-converted DNA"

Notes and troubleshooting\n\nAmplification of bisulfite-converted DNA\nAmplification of bisulfite-treated DNA can be problematic due to DNA damage arising from the harsh conditions required for near-complete conversion of unmethylated cytosines. Conversion conditions should be optimized to minimize the extent of DNA damage while ensuring sufficient conversion efficiency. Because bisulfite treatment converts cytosines to uracils, which are subsequently substituted with thymines during PCR, bisulfite-converted DNA is typically much more AT-rich than the original source DNA. This should be considered carefully when designing PCR primers, and cycling parameters such as annealing temperature may require special attention.\n\n\nMgCl2 concentration\nKAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ ReadyMix contains a final (1X) MgCl2 concentration of 2.5 mM, which is sufficient for most applications. Applications which are likely to require higher MgCl2 concentrations include long PCR (&gt;10 kb) and AT-rich PCR, as well as amplification using primers with a low GC content (&lt;40%). Note that bisulfiteconverted DNA is typically very AT-rich, as are the primers used for amplification of these templates; this application may therefore require additional MgCl2.\n\n\nPrevention of amplicon contamination with UDG\nFor effective removal of carryover contamination, dUTP must be added routinely to PCR reactions with KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ ReadyMix. Typically, dUTP is added to a concentration of 0.2 mM, but short AT-poor amplicons may require up to 0.3 mM dUTP for effective removal using UDG. For amplicons &gt;600 bp, a lower dUTP concentration (≤ 0.1 mM) may be required for efficient amplification. Low amplification efficiencies may result from incomplete UDG inactivation, in which case a longer initial denaturation may be required to inactivate the UDG prior to cycling. Refer to the manufacturer’s recommendations for optimal UDG concentration, and incubation/inactivation conditions.\n\n\nDenaturation\nDue to the high salt concentration of the KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ ReadyMix, it is important to use appropriate denaturation parameters. An initial denaturation time of 2–5 min at 95°C is recommended to ensure that complex template DNA is fully denatured before the first primer annealing step. Use 5 min for complex, genomic DNA and/ or GC-rich targets, and at least 45 sec for less complex templates such as purified viral or plasmid DNA.\n\n\nAnnealing temperature\nDue to the high salt concentration of the KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ ReadyMix, the optimal annealing temperature for a given primer set is usually different when compared with other PCR buffer systems. When using the kit with a specific primer pair for the first time, determine the optimal annealing temperature with annealing temperature gradient PCR. We recommend a gradient from 60–72°C, although some assays may require even higher annealing temperatures. For assays with optimal annealing temperatures of 68°C or higher, 2-step cycling may be performed at the optimal annealing temperature. Optimal annealing temperatures below 60°C are typically rare, but may be necessary when using primers with a high AT content, as is often the case with amplification of bisulfite-converted DNA. If a gradient PCR is not feasible, use an annealing temperature of 60°C as a first approach, and adjust the annealing temperature based on the results obtained: • If a low yield of only the specific product is obtained, lower the annealing temperature in 1–2°C increments. • If nonspecific products are formed in addition to the specific product, increase the annealing temperature in 1–2°C increments. • If no product is formed (specific or nonspecific), reduce the annealing temperature by 5°C. MgCl2 concentration may have to be increased. If only nonspecific products are formed (in a ladder-like pattern), increase the annealing temperature by 5°C.\n\n\nAmplicon length\nKAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ ReadyMix can amplify targets up to 18 kb in length from simple purified template such as plasmid DNA, and up to 15 kb in length from high quality (i.e. not bisulfite-treated), complex genomic DNA. For efficient amplification of fragments ≥10 kb, higher template concentrations, and optimization of the Mg2+ concentration, may be required.\n\n\nPrimer and template DNA quality\nPrimers should be designed to minimize the possibility of primer-dimer formation, self-priming, or nonspecific priming. Primer pairs should have similar theoretical melting temperatures (Tm), and should have a GC content of 40–60%, although this may not be feasible for bisulfite-converted template DNA. Primers with a GC content 60% may require higher denaturation temperatures or longer denaturation times, while primers with a GC content 40% may require lower annealing temperatures and increased MgCl2 concentrations. Template DNA quality has a significant impact on the success of PCR amplification. Degraded, damaged, or sheared template DNA is usually problematic. While KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ ReadyMix tolerates uracil, deamination of dCMP to dUMP in the DNA template will generate G/C to A/T mutations during amplification. NOTE: Always dilute and store primers and DNA in a buffered solution (e.g. 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 – 8.5) instead of PCR-grade water, and minimize freeze-thaw cycles to limit degradation and maintain primer quality.\n\n\nCycle number\nExcessive library amplification should be avoided to minimize the following adverse effects: • increased duplicate reads • uneven coverage depth and sequence dropout • chimeric library inserts • nucleotide substitutions • heteroduplex formation To minimize over-amplification and associated unwanted artifacts, the number of amplification cycles should be optimized to ensure a sufficient amount of amplified library for the next step in the workflow (capture or sequencing), plus the amount needed for library QC and/or archiving. Depending on the sequencing application and degree of multiplexing, 100 ng – 1.5 μg of amplified library is typically required. The number of cycles typically required will vary, depending on input amount and quality. Size selection of libraries at any part in the library construction process results in significant loss of material and as a result, 2–4 additional cycles are required for workflows which include a sizeselection step prior to library amplification.\n\n\nPrimer depletion and library over-amplification\nIn library amplification reactions (set up according to the recommended protocol), primers are typically depleted before dNTPs. When DNA synthesis can no longer take place due to primer depletion, subsequent rounds of DNA denaturation and annealing result in the separation of complementary DNA strands, followed by imperfect annealing to non-complementary partners. This presumably results in the formation of so-called “daisychains” or tangled knots, comprising large assemblies of improperly annealed, partially double-stranded, heteroduplex DNA. These species migrate slower and are observed as secondary, higher molecular weight peaks during the electrophoretic analysis of amplified libraries. However, they are typically comprised of library molecules of the desired length, which are separated during denaturation prior to target enrichment (capture) or cluster amplification. Since these heteroduplexes contain significant portions of single-stranded DNA, over-amplification leads to the under-quantification of library molecules with assays employing dsDNA-binding dyes. qPCR-based library quantification methods, such as that employed by the KAPA Library Quantification Kit, quantify DNA by denaturation and amplification, thereby providing a more accurate measurement of the amount of adapter-ligated molecules—even if the library was over-amplified."

Therefore, it is best to use filtered tips when working with different samples to prevent cross contamination from any sample that has gotten into the pipette (ex. when pipetting different DNA samples for a DNA extraction)\nUnfiltered tips are appropriate to use when pipetting solutions, dyes, and buffers, i.e. things less likely to cause significant contamination to other pipetted materials.

Check the amount on the pipette is correct. When pipetting, be sure only to push down on the plunger to the first stop and slowly release to pick up the liquid until your thumb comes completely off the plunger. If you go past the first stop, you will draw up more liquid than the amount you set on the pipette and/or create bubbles. If you push down and then release quickly to draw up liquid, it can cause aspiration and contaminate the pipette if you aren’t using filtered tips. If you are using filtered tips, aspiration can cause liquid to land on the filter, so the pipette tip will hold less liquid than you specified.

Ensure to only go to the first stop for each of the 3 times.\nCheck the pipette tip has the correct amount. Look at the pipette tip, or all the pipette tips if using the multichannel.

    "text": "Edit this page\n\nHere is a presentation from Research Computing on terminology and optimizing workflows in the lab: Optimization_Lotterhos_labmeeting_Sekar-V2.pdf\nTo view your recent jobs, use acct -S 2020-08-01 -u lotterhos will list all jobs since that date for user lotterhos\nTo learn about how much memory a job used, type seff jobID - will give memory for the job that was requested and how much was used.\nCheck job efficiency and performance:\na. R code in part c from Workflow parralelization approaches shows an example of how you can capture the run time of a particular job, or a parallel segment by printing out the time difference it takes to calculate a particular part. You can also modify this to calculate the total time it took to run your code. To find the best performance, I would recommend to benchmark the calculations on (for example) 1,24,8,16,32 cores and see if at some point it levels off in terms of run time, this may mean that there would be no benefit to request more cores beyond that. Research Computing can discuss performance testing, just schedule another consultation time.\nb. You can also look at the efficiency and memory usage of your jobs by looking at the completed jobs from your slurm history, by typing: acct -S 2020-08-10 -u albecker Then, selecting a particular job (might be beneficial to have a small script that runs through all jobs, since you had over 100,000 jobs this month, I can help with that too if needed) and using the seff command to extract the efficiency. For example:\n$ seff 13291706\nJob ID: 13291706\nCluster: discovery\nUser/Group: albecker/users\nState: COMPLETED (exit code 0)\nCores: 1\nCPU Utilized: 00:01:58\nCPU Efficiency: 99.16% of 00:01:59 core-walltime\nJob Wall-clock time: 00:01:59\nMemory Utilized: 284.50 MB\nMemory Efficiency: 0.56% of 50.00 GB\nHere, you can see that the CPU efficiency was very high at 99%, but you ended up using less than 1% of the memory you requested (284.50 MB out of 50.00 GB). This information is useful to better allocate and utilize resources in the future.\nc. It is also recommended to perform short testing prior to submit long jobs to the cluster. You can use the “debug”, “express” or the “lotterhos” partition and you can run the job interactively. For example, this will give you resources on the debug partition (up to 20 minutes). srun -p debug --nodes=1 --ntasks=16 --pty /bin/bash\n\n\nFor example, the lotterhos partition runs a lot faster than the short partition\nIf you optimize on the lotterhos partition, then your jobs will run out of time on the short partition\n\n\n\nHere is an example header for an array script:\n#SBATCH --job-name=SlimRun\n#SBATCH --mail-user=k.lotterhos@northeastern.edu\n#SBATCH --mail-type=FAIL\n#SBATCH --partition=lotterhos\n#SBATCH --mem=4G\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --CPUs-per-task=2\n#SBATCH --array=50-151%70\n#SBATCH --output=/work/lotterhos/MVP-NonClinalAF/slurm_log/SlimRun20210826_%j.out\n#SBATCH --error=/work/lotterhos/MVP-NonClinalAF/slurm_log/SlimRun20210826_%j.err\n\nsource ~/miniconda3/bin/activate MVP_env\nThe Lotterhos partition has 72 Cores, divided across two nodes. First, you need to know more about the how the programs that your script will call work. Can thay utilize multiple cores (threads)? Or do they only use one core?\nThis is an example header from a submission script for an array that reads in rows 50-150 from a file that has the parameters that I want to run.\nAnd explanation of the following terms:\n#SBATCH --array=50-151%70\n\nThis will run 101 array tasks, for parameters 50-151 in the filename, and submit 70 jobs at a time.\nIf each task in array requires 1 CPU, you could also run up to 72 jobs at at time with 50-151%72, to maximize the resources in the lotterhos partition. But, it is good to leave a couple of cores open for srun tasks.\nIf each task requires 2 CPUS, set --CPUs-per-task=2 (look it up) and set --array=50-151%36 to maximize the resources in the lotterhos partition.\nIF programs can use multiple threads, do benchmarking to determine CPU per task, 1-2 jobs at a time, and do seff on those tasks that completed (see below). Test 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 CPUs. Then set that in the line.\n\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n\nSet this to 1 unless we know the program can communicate between the nodes.\nIf you set this to 1 and you set 50-151%72, it will use both nodes on lotterhos, but only one CPU per node.

    "text": "Edit this page\nSteps to take if errors occur during installation\n\nWhen initially trying to use CellProfiler, I had some issues during the installation process. This was primarily due to the fact that CellProfiler only uses Python 2.7 (They are developing a new version that will be built on Python 3) and is fairly sensitive to versions of libraries it needs. Also, I was having some issues with permissions as well. I will walk through these issues here.\n\n\nOne subtle mistake that person could make during the installation process is not using the correct version of pip. Given that there are separate versions of pip for Python 2.7 and for Python 3, you could just be mistakenly trying to install CellProfiler with the wrong version of pip. I say this because the command install CellProfiler is this:\nuser@comp5:~/Cellprofiler$ pip install -e .\nSeems pretty straightforward but that assumption could lead to some trouble. The pip command could be specifying either pip for python 2.7 or some version of python3. There should be a pip2.7 command to specify which of the two versions you are trying to use. Use this command. If you do not do this, you will likely get an error saying that you do not have the correct version of Python and you will be confused.\nThis also applies to prerequisite libraries you are installing as well.\n\n\n\nAnother issue that you might run into when installing is permission errors. Here is what I got when I ran the command for installation suggested by CellProfiler documentation:\nuser@comp5:~/Cellprofiler$ pip2.7 install -e .\n\nERROR: Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/bin/cellprofiler'\nConsider using the `--user` option or check the permissions.\nYou can try to run it with the --user flag as suggested but this is what I got when I did that:\nuser@comp5:~/Cellprofiler$ pip2.7 install -e . --user\n\nERROR: Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/bin/cellprofiler'\nCheck the permissions.\nThe only way that I was able to get by these permission errors was to install it using sudo:\nuser@comp5:~/Cellprofiler$ sudo pip2.7 install -e .\n\n\n\nNow this is where a installation complication lies. Proper installation of certain libraries and packages is incredibly important on RedHat systems and it really matters here.

    "text": "Edit this page\n\n\n\nBrief review of using the #SBATCH --array slurm argument to restrict the number of jobs running in parallel on Discovery. Arrays seem to be most effective when you have a large number of jobs that all require the same number of resources and the user wants to limit the amount of the computing resource being used at a particular time. This guide follows the same template format from the lotterhos wiki, which reads through and leverages a reference file that contains a number of file names corresponding to files you wish to process. For example, this cod contain a list of raw sequence files (e.g., fq.gz) that you with to perform trimming and qc on.\n\n\nThe --array argument can take a single integer,1, or a range, 1-32, of integers that the slurm script will iterate through. Following the range of integers you specify the number of these values you wish to process simultaneously using the % operator. For example, if you wish to iterate through the range of integers in batches of 4 you could code: #SBATCH --array=1-32%4\nOther options\n# A job array with array tasks numbered 1, 2, 5, 19, 27.\n#SBATCH --array=1,2,5,19,27\n\n# A job array with array tasks numbered 1, 3, 5 and 7.\n#SBATCH --array=1-7:2\n\n\n\nIncluding the above example (#SBATCH --array=1-32%4) in your slurm script will effectively iterate through your slurm script 32 times, by running 4 simultaneous instances (or jobs) of the script at a time on Discovery. However, running the same script with identical parameters (or files) may not be particularly useful. Instead we probably want to run the same script but apply it to a different set of data or use different parameters. At the very least we want to be able to create unique outputs for each iteration!\nConviently, the --array argument creats a unix variable - SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID, which in the case above references the specific integer that corresponds to the particular instances of the script. For example, the first iteration of your slurm script will have SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID=1.\nThis could be leveraged in multiple ways, but one option is using this index to extract specific lines from a reference script. The data on these lines could be anything, but having file names is a particular useful approach if you want to apply your script to multiple files.\nShort illustration\nVARNAME=`sed \"${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}q;d\" path/to/reference/reference.txt`\n\nfile1 = path/to/data/${VARNAME}\n\necho '${file1}'\nExample of reference file:\ndatafile1.csv\ndatafile2.csv\ndatafile3.csv\nExample output in .out file\ndatafile1.csv\ndatafile2.csv\ndatafile3.csv\n\n\n\nThe lotterhos partition has 2 nodes, 36 cores per node, and 5GB per core. A job that only uses a single cpu should not take up more than 5GB of memory.\nHere is an example of an array that runs 72 jobs at a time, each job runs on one core. In the remaining script, not shown, is code that reads the input parameters from a file that has 1000 lines (the first line is the header, and each line after that has parameters). Hence, the array starts on line 2 and goes to line 1000. Unless the program is able to cross-talk among nodes (most do not have the architecture to do that), then nodes should always be set to 1. However, this script will run arrays across both lotterhos nodes (the nodes=1 just indicates that each task will use one node).\n#SBATCH --partition=lotterhos\n#SBATCH --mem=5GB\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --array=2-1000%70\n1000 is the upper limit that can be requested by the “array” command. It’s also good to keep the total number of jobs submitted at a time capped at 70, so that a couple of cores are left open for srun\nBelow is an example of a job that calls a program that can use multiple cpus. If 32 cpus are requested, then 32 cpus * 5GB/cpu = 160GB can be also requested for memory. Unless the program is able to cross-talk among nodes (most do not have the architecture to do that), then nodes should always be set to 1. y Since there are only 2 nodes, each with 36 cpus, then we can only run 2 jobs at a time and stay within the bounds of the architecture. Hence thearray=2-1000%2 argument\n#SBATCH --partition=lotterhos\n#SBATCH --mem=160GB\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=32\n#SBATCH --array=2-1000%2\n\n\n\nScript performs bismark mapping, bismark on list of files based on the file names in a reference text file, sample_files.txt. Based on the --array argument, I am peforming the mapping on 32 samples, processing 4 samples at a time.\n    #!/bin/bash\n\n    #SBATCH --job-name=DNAMethylation_mapping\n    #SBATCH --mem=100Gb\n    #SBATCH --mail-user=downey-wall.a@northeastern.edu\n    #SBATCH --mail-type=FAIL\n    #SBATCH --partition=lotterhos\n    #SBATCH --nodes=1\n    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=32\n    #SBATCH --array=1-32%2\n    #SBATCH --output=/work/lotterhos/2018OALarvae_DNAm/slurm_log/DNAm_mapping_%j.out\n    #SBATCH --error=/work/lotterhos/2018OALarvae_DNAm/slurm_log/DNAm_mapping_%j.err\n\n    ## Store name of individual sample\n    VARNAME=`sed \"${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}q;d\" 2018OALarvae_DNAm/RAW/sample_files.txt`\n\n    ## Code for running bismark (DNA methylation sequence mapper)\n\n    i=$(ls 2018OALarvae_DNAm/trimmed_files/${VARNAME}_R1*fq.gz | rev | cut -d'/' -f 1 | rev) \n    j=$(ls 2018OALarvae_DNAm/trimmed_files/${VARNAME}_R2*fq.gz | rev | cut -d'/' -f 1 | rev)\n\n    # Run Bismark\n    bismark --non_directional \\\n    --parallel 32 \\\n    --genome oyster_references/haplo_tig_genome \\\n    --score_min L,0,-0.4 \\\n    --bowtie2 \\\n    -1 2018OALarvae_DNAm/trimmed_files/${i} \\\n    -2 2018OALarvae_DNAm/trimmed_files/${j} \\\n    -o 2018OALarvae_DNAm/mapped_files\nBelow are some examples of scripts written to progress to using an Array\n\n\n\n\nIn this script, I copied the exact same lines of codes that I would use to run these processes in the Discovery Cluster into a batch script.\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=Pop1_16220DellyGridss\n#SBATCH --mail-user=curtis.lei@northeastern.edu\n#SBATCH --partition=lotterhos\n#SBATCH --mem=25Gb\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=5\n#SBATCH --output=/home/curtis.lei/2024Cod_Inversions/slurm_log/Pop1_16220DellyGridss.out\n#SBATCH --error=/home/curtis.lei/2024Cod_Inversions/slurm_log/Pop1_16220DellyGridss.err\n\n## Load the necessary modules\nmodule load singularity/3.10.3\nmodule load samtools/1.19.2\necho \"module load complete\"\n\n## Sort and Index the BAM File in GRIDSS Cod Data folder\ncd /home/curtis.lei/gridss/cod_data\ncp /work/lotterhos/2020_CodGenomes/labeled_bam_Out/Pop1_16220.f.rg.bam /home/curtis.lei/cod_data\nsamtools sort -m 40G Pop1_16220.f.rg.bam &gt; Pop1_16220.sorted.f.rg.bam\nsamtools index Pop1_16220.sorted.f.rg.bam\necho \"sort and index complete\"\n\n## Run Delly\nsingularity run /home/curtis.lei/Containers/delly_v1.2.6.sif delly call -g /home/curtis.lei/gridss/cod_data/GCF_902167405.1_gadMor3.0_genomic.fna /home/curtis.lei/gridss/cod_data/Pop1_16220.sorted.f.rg.bam &gt; /home/curtis.lei/delly/delly.Pop1_16220.vcf\necho \"delly complete\"\n\n## Run GRIDSS on generated Delly VCF\nsingularity run /home/curtis.lei/Containers/gridss_2.13.2.sif gridss_extract_overlapping_fragments --targetvcf /home/curtis.lei/delly/delly.Pop1_16220.vcf Pop1_16220.sorted.f.rg.bam\nsingularity run /home/curtis.lei/Containers/gridss_2.13.2.sif gridss -r GCF_902167405.1_gadMor3.0_genomic.fna -o /home/curtis.lei/gridss/gridssDelly.Pop1_16220.vcf Pop1_16220.sorted.f.rg.bam.targeted.bam\necho \"GRIDSS complete\"\n\n\n\nIn this script, I slightly modified Script 1.

The data on these lines could be anything, but having file names is a particular useful approach if you want to apply your script to multiple files.\nShort illustration\nVARNAME=`sed \"${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}q;d\" path/to/reference/reference.txt`\n\nfile1 = path/to/data/${VARNAME}\n\necho '${file1}'\nExample of reference file:\ndatafile1.csv\ndatafile2.csv\ndatafile3.csv\nExample output in .out file\ndatafile1.csv\ndatafile2.csv\ndatafile3.csv\n\n\n\nThe lotterhos partition has 2 nodes, 36 cores per node, and 5GB per core. A job that only uses a single cpu should not take up more than 5GB of memory.\nHere is an example of an array that runs 72 jobs at a time, each job runs on one core. In the remaining script, not shown, is code that reads the input parameters from a file that has 1000 lines (the first line is the header, and each line after that has parameters). Hence, the array starts on line 2 and goes to line 1000. Unless the program is able to cross-talk among nodes (most do not have the architecture to do that), then nodes should always be set to 1. However, this script will run arrays across both lotterhos nodes (the nodes=1 just indicates that each task will use one node).\n#SBATCH --partition=lotterhos\n#SBATCH --mem=5GB\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --array=2-1000%70\n1000 is the upper limit that can be requested by the “array” command. It’s also good to keep the total number of jobs submitted at a time capped at 70, so that a couple of cores are left open for srun\nBelow is an example of a job that calls a program that can use multiple cpus. If 32 cpus are requested, then 32 cpus * 5GB/cpu = 160GB can be also requested for memory. Unless the program is able to cross-talk among nodes (most do not have the architecture to do that), then nodes should always be set to 1. y Since there are only 2 nodes, each with 36 cpus, then we can only run 2 jobs at a time and stay within the bounds of the architecture. Hence thearray=2-1000%2 argument\n#SBATCH --partition=lotterhos\n#SBATCH --mem=160GB\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=32\n#SBATCH --array=2-1000%2\n\n\n\nScript performs bismark mapping, bismark on list of files based on the file names in a reference text file, sample_files.txt.

Mix thoroughly by vortexing and centrifuge ~30 seconds.\nUse the equation c1v1=c2v2 to calculate volumes needed to get your target values for total amount of DNA and total volume of liquid to dry.\n\nNote: We have found that 15ul volumes take about 2.5 hours to dry in the SpeedVac. 400ng of DNA is likely enough to send for sequencing, but you can dry 1000ng or more to be safe.\n- Equation variables: \n    - c1 = concentration 1, the original DNA concentration of each sample.\n    - v1 = volume 1, the volume of each sample removed for drying.\n    - c2 = concentration 2, the desired concentration of each sample after it has been diluted for drying, standardized across all samples.\n    - v2 = volume 2, the total volume of water and sample you are drying.\n\n- Example:\n    - c1 = concentrations based on Picogreen assay\n    - v1 = ?\n    - c2 = 50 ng/ul (dilute each sample to this concentration)\n    - v2 = 15ul (amount of water and sample at a concentration of 50 ng/uL that would be dried)\n- This example would yield 750ng of dried DNA: 15ul * 50ng/ul = 750ng\n\nPipette appropriate amounts of sample and molecular grade water into a PCR plate according to values calculated above for desired concentration, volume, and total ng of DNA. Pipette up and down 5-10 times to mix DNA and water.\nThe SpeedVac is located in the shared molecular space. There is silicone grease in the upper drawer under the ultracentrifuge. Ensure that the SpeedVac seal has been greased thoroughly before using. If needed, add more grease to the black rim and check for a tight seal when closing the lid.\nEnsure SpeedVac is on the no heat setting and the timer is set for an adequate amount of time (at least 3 hours). Use plate attachment and place sample plate and counterweight into the holders. Leave plate uncovered The lid will not open until the SpeedVac is on.\nStart SpeedVac. Check samples periodically (every 30 minutes or so) for drying, remove plate as soon as everything is dry. If the process is slow, you can add more of the silicone grease. The process speeds up significantly after adding grease, so make sure to check samples often if you do add grease.\nCover dried DNA plate with a plastic cover and store in the fridge or immediately prepare it for shipment.",

Pour 100mL 10X TAE in the large plastic graduated cyliner. Add 900mL MilliQ water until the mixture reaches the 1000mL mark. Pour and store in a 1L labelled glass bottle. The recipe for making more 10X TAE Buffer is below and here\nMix the gel components.\n\nFor a 1% agarose gel:\n\nSmall gel: 0.60g agarose + 60 mL 1X TAE Buffer  add links to recipe \nMedium gel: 1 g agarose + 100 mL 1X TAE Buffer\n\nFor a 2% agarose gel: i. Small gel: 1.2g agarose + 60 mL 1X TAE Buffer\n\nMedium gel: 2g agarose + 100 mL 1X TAE Buffer\n\nWeigh agarose using a plastic small weigh boat. Pour into Erlenmeyer flask. Measure 1X TAE using an 100mL graduated cyliner. Pour into Erlenmeyer flask and swirl gently.\nUse the magnetic stirring plate (put a stir bar inside the Erlenmeyer flask) to mix. Turn the RPM into the 500s until all the clumps are gone. Remove the stir bar with forceps.\n\nMelt the gel.\n\nMicrowave the flask with agarose mixture for ~30 seconds.\n\nAlways watch for boiling. If mixture begins to bubble, remove it immediately and carefully swirl until bubbles are gone.\n\nWith hot mitt, remove the flask from microwave and gently swirl.\n\nBe careful—it will be hot! Hold the flask away from you and gently swirl to avoid splashing.\n\nReturn the flask to microwave and continue heating for another 30-40 seconds until mixture is clear and there are no agarose particles.\n\nAllow to cool.\n\nGently swirl while cooling. The solution should be cool enough to hold in the palm of your hand. This can take a couple minutes, please be patient.\n\nAdd GelRed:\n\nSmall gel: 6ul.\nMedium gel: 10 uL\n\nGelRed can be found in the drawer labeled “Lotterhos” in the shared wet lab/gel room.\n\nGently swirl until the stain is dissolved (you should not be able to see any red stain in the gel).\n\nPour the gel.\n\nUse masking tape to create walls on either side of the tray to contain the solution when poured. Test tape by filling tray with water first. Use multiple layers of tape to make sure it doesn’t leak. \n\nIf you are having issues with this method (leaks), you can set the gel in the rig if you flip the orientation of the tray so that it is confined. Make sure to wet the red rubber gaskets so that it is easier to take out after it has set. The rig needs to be empty for this method (no buffer in it). \n\nPour gel slowly to avoid bubbles.\n\nIf bubbles form, you can pop them using a pipette tip.\n\nAdd casting combs into the slots.\n\nThere are 2 pairs of combs for each size gel; one will create wider wells than the other. You can use either set of combs.\n\nRinse out the flask and hang on drying rack in Lotterhos lab.\n\nLet the gel set for ~40 minutes.\n\nThe gel should be solid, cool to the touch, and opaque.\nOnce gel is set, remove the tape and combs.\n\nRemove combs slowly, pulling straight up. It might be easier to do this if the gel is in the buffer.\n\n\nMake sure that the power source is off, and the gel rig is unplugged from the power source before removing the top.\nPlace the tray with your gel in the gel rig with wells on the side with the black plug\n\nSamples will run from the black side toward red side.\nDNA “runs to red” \n\nFill rig with enough 1X TAE Buffer to just cover the entire gel.\n\nThe rig doesn’t need to be filled all the way to the line, just enough to cover the gel.\n\nAdd ladder into the first well.\n\nMix 1ul ladder, 1ul TriTrack loading dye, and 4ul DI H20. Mix on parafilm or in a Qubit tube. Fill ladder wells with 3ul (half) of this mixture. Repeat or make a double batch depending on how many ladders you have.\n\nWe use the Generuler 1kb Plus DNA. Before pipetting, centrifuge the ladder briefly with the loading dye (for balance) so that there are no drips on the sides of the tubes.\nAliquots of ladder can be found in the -20 freezer. (we don’t have an aliquot right now, you might have to mix ladder/TriTrack/DIH20 yourself.\n\n\nLoad the gel.\n\nPlace the DNA samples on ice in the styrofoam box once they have defrosted.\nIf there is any gel inside the wells, clean them out by pipetting up TAE and expelling it into the wells\nCut a piece of parafilm and tape to benchtop. You can label it with sample names or well numbers if that’s helpful.\nUsing a pipette, add dots of 6X loading dye (1 for each sample) to parafilm. \n\nThe loading dye is blue and can be found in the -20 freezer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading DNA into gel wells\n\n\n\nRight before taking your 3ul of DNA, make sure to vortex the sample to ensure DNA is evenly dispersed throughout the tube. Forgetting to vortex can result in gels where no band is visible, or super streaky, as DNA may be stuck on the bottom of the sample well rather than suspended in the buffer.\n\n\nd.  Using a pipette **with filtered tips**, add DNA sample to a dot of loading dye.\n&lt;img width=\"460\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-03-24 at 2 55 12 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122108419/227614980-fc8435a5-46c8-47be-9839-8136d1aa8c28.png\"&gt;\n i. We use 3ul DNA + 1ul loading dye.\n \ne.  Mix by pipetting up and down slowly 3+ times.\n\nf.  Keep the same tip and pipette 3 ul of the dye/sample solution into the proper well of the gel.\n\ng.  Repeat for each sample\n    i. Change your pipette tip for each sample.\n    ii. Make sure to use new dot of dye for each sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPipetting into gel wells\n\n\n\nWhen pipetting into gel wells, be careful not to break the agarose or stick the pipette tip too far into the well so that the sample ejects into the agarose. Position your pipette tip just inside the well and check for dye in the correct well after you pipette it. Check to see if the agarose around the well breaks. Take a note if the agarose breaks around a well. (Will add a photo here)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a 2- or 3-gel layout for a 96-well plate of samples\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a sample gel layout for how you could organize your samples into gels if you have a plate of 96. This layout uses 3 medium gels with 2 20-well combs each. Because there are so many wells in each row, it may be useful to have one member keeping track of which well is the next to load and another member to actually load the gel.\nGel 1: \nGel 2: \nGel 3: \n\n\n\nGel 1: \nGel 2: \n\n\n\n\nRun the gel.\n\nPut the gel box cover into place.\n\nMake sure the wires are plugged in correctly (wire colors match plug colors).\nTurn on the power supply and set timer. For a 1% gel, set it for 130V for 30 minutes. For a 2% gel, we found that 90V for 35 minutes works better.\n\nCheck for bubbles rising at cathode (black plug) side to ensure the rig is working. If you do not see bubbles rising, the gel is not running.

Never run a protocol that maxes out the voltage.\nYou can safely run up to 4 small gels or 2 medium gels at most simultaneously on the power supply. Do not run more gels than the machine can handle, or it may break the machine.\nNever connect/disconnect cords from the power supply’s power jacks while the blue indicator light is on or when the screen says “Running.”\nMake sure area around the power supply is dry and clean\nWait 5 seconds after ending a run before handling the cords/output leads/gel rig.\nFor proper ventilation, leave at least 10 cm of space behind the instrument, and at least 5 cm of space on each side.\nInformation based on Appendix D of the safety manual\n\n\n\n\nVisualize the gel.\n\nTurn the power supply off.\nRemove the cover from the gel box.\nCarefully remove the tray and gel.\n\nTry to drip excess buffer back into the rig, scraping the bottom of the tray on the edge of the box.\n\nThe gel doc (for visualizing the gel) is in OGL, in the room you walk through right before the autoclave room. The gel doc is a large grey machine on the benchtop next to a black computer. Open the gel doc tray and wipe it clean using MilliQ water and KimWipes.\n\nA small volume of water (&lt;10ml) is sufficient.\n\nSlide the gel onto the gel doc tray. You can also keep the gel in its plastic tray and put the whole thing on the gel doc.\n\nDo so slowly to avoid creating bubbles under the gel.\nIf you’re unsure if your gel has run long enough, you can leave gel in tray and visualize it. You can then return the gel to the rig and run it for longer if necessary.\n\nClose the tray.\nOpen “Image Lab” application on the OGL laptop connected to the gel doc.\nCheck that the cord labeled “Gel doc” is plugged into the computer.\nSelect New Protocol.\nUnder “Application”, select Nucleic Acid Gels and then GelRed.\n\nThe default setting is to optimize for most intense bands which prevents the gel from being over exposed but may make very faint samples undetectable.\nIf necessary, under “Image Exposure” you can select exposure to optimize for faintest bands or set a manual exposure time.\nIf you are running a gel with samples of highly variable concentrations, it may be useful to run protocols with each optimization option.\n\nSelect “Position Gel” (yellow button on the left side of the window).\n\nThe program will ask you to check that the filter is set to Filter 1.\nCheck that the arm on the upper right side of the gel doc is in the center position labeled Filter 1.\n\nOpen door on the front of the gel doc and position your gel.\n\nYou can zoom in and out under image window on the computer screen.\nYou can enable grid lines by checking the box in the bottom corner of the screen.\n\nClose door and select “Run Protocol” (green button on the left side of the window).\nWait for the gel image to load.\nSave image or change protocol and run again.\nTo save as .jpg image:\n\nSelect File&gt;Export&gt;Export for Publication&gt;Select Export.\nChange file type to .jpg.\nName file and save in appropriate folder. We have a Lotterhos folder on the OGL laptop.\n\n\nAlways clean the gel doc tray after use. You can use MilliQ water from the squirt bottle near the gel doc and a Kimwipe to clean the tray of any remaining gel or TAE. Make sure the tray is dry before you leave.\nDispose of the gel in the mayo jar in the gel room labeled ‘Gel waste.’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGel waste\n\n\n\n\nIf the gel waste mayo jar is labelled with Lotterhos, ensure that the label is filled out correctly. GelRed and Bromophenol blue are not hazardous, and the label should be filled out as such if those are the only constituents. You should also ask others who use the gel mayo jar about what chemicals are in their gels.\n\n\n\n\nRinse gel tray and let dry on drying rack above the sink in the gel room.\nInterpret your gel. See guidelines below (under the old gel protocol) for an example and information on how to interpret your gel.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, ensure your ladder ran cleanly. You want to see relatively straight and separated lines. Some will have higher feedback when imaging.\nUse the ladder to determine the size in basepairs of your DNA samples.\n\nThermo Fisher GeneRuler 1 kb Plus Ladder, 75-20,000 kbp (ladder we have in the lab)\n\n\nAs shown in the image above, the ladder has 15 distinct bands representing strands of 75 bp at the lowest band to 20,000 bp at the topmost band. In practice, however, lines representing 3,000-20,000 bp tend to be squished together. What matters most for genomic DNA to be sent for sequencing is ensuring your DNA strands are long enough (&gt; 3,000 bp) to indicate a successful extraction.\n\nExample Gel\n\n2% agarose gel with ladders in the rightmost and leftmost wells, a blank in the second well from the right, and three oyster genomic DNA samples in the remaining wells.\n\nBoth ladders ran nicely. The bands are mostly spaced out with minimal streaking.\n\nNote the clustered bands in the ladders for 3,000-20,000 bp\n\nThe second well, a blank, contains nothing beyond loading dye. As there was no sample running there, the image shows no DNA present, which is as it should be.\nSamples 1 and 2 ran properly- each has a clear distinct line placing them between 3,000-20,000 bp in length (appropriate for genomic DNA). These samples appear to be in a good state for sequencing.\nSample 3, on the other hand, is streaky, indicating that the DNA likely degraded during the electrophoresis process. There is one bright band up near the top in the 3,000-20,000 bp range, which is good, but this sample probably isn’t in the best shape for sequencing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if I make the wrong percent agarose gel?\n\nComparison between ladder expression in 1% vs. 2% agarose gels\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen removing the combs from a set gel, remove very gently and pull them straight up and out to keep pieces of gel from getting loosened and knocked into the well.\nMake sure not to touch the sides of the wells with the pipette tip when adding samples in.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe voltage machine may give an “E1” error and will not begin running. When this happens, check that there is enough TAE buffer in the rig such that the ends of the electrodes are submerged. Add more 1X TAE if not.\nAlso check that electrodes are tightened on each side. The red one on rig 2 tends to get a bit loose.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour sample may have degraded. Be careful not to leave DNA samples in the fridge for more than 4 or 5 days and try not to thaw and refreeze samples too many times.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe protocol for running a gel. Madeline’s lab notebook (labeled “Eppley”) has written protocols and troubleshooting for gels on pages 2-3 (not the new protocol).\n\n\n\n\nAgarose\n1X TAE (you can also use TBE, but we regularly have TAE stock pre-made). Here’s a link to a TAE recipe for TAE. We should have all materials in the lab. If using 10x TAE stock, dilute with 100 mL TAE to 900 mL milliq water.\nGelRed® 10,000X stock reagent (left-top drawer in the room with gel docks).\nErlenmeyer flask (should be in the room with gel docks).\n\n\n\n\n\nTare a weigh boat on the scale.\nAdd 1.4 g of agarose to the weigh boat.\nPour 70 mL of 1x TAE buffer into a graduated cylinder.\nPour 35-40 mL of the TAE buffer into an Erlenmeyer flask, then add the agarose and swirl.\nMicrowave solution for ~45 seconds, or until it begins to boil.\nAdd more TAE buffer, but leave 10-20 mL in the graduated cylinder.\nMicrowave solution again until it begins to boil. Repeat until agarose is completely dissolved.\nAdd remaining TAE buffer (to cool solution).\nDilute the GelRed® 10,000X stock reagent into the molten agarose gel solution at 1:10,000 and mix thoroughly.\n\n(e.g., 5 µL of the GelRed 10,000X stock reagent added to 50 mL of the gel solution)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis source detailes a full protocol for running a gel: https://www.addgene.org/protocols/gel-electrophoresis/\nSource from Remy for Gel protocol (note that this is for an Ethidium Bromide system, and we are Ethidium-Bromide free at the MSC): Gel Electrophoresis protocol_lab interns.pdf",

Pour 100mL 10X TAE in the large plastic graduated cyliner. Add 900mL MilliQ water until the mixture reaches the 1000mL mark. Pour and store in a 1L labelled glass bottle. The recipe for making more 10X TAE Buffer is below and here\nMix the gel components.\n\nFor a 1% agarose gel:\n\nSmall gel: 0.60g agarose + 60 mL 1X TAE Buffer  add links to recipe \nMedium gel: 1 g agarose + 100 mL 1X TAE Buffer\n\nFor a 2% agarose gel: i. Small gel: 1.2g agarose + 60 mL 1X TAE Buffer\n\nMedium gel: 2g agarose + 100 mL 1X TAE Buffer\n\nWeigh agarose using a plastic small weigh boat. Pour into Erlenmeyer flask. Measure 1X TAE using an 100mL graduated cyliner. Pour into Erlenmeyer flask and swirl gently.\nUse the magnetic stirring plate (put a stir bar inside the Erlenmeyer flask) to mix. Turn the RPM into the 500s until all the clumps are gone. Remove the stir bar with forceps.\n\nMelt the gel.\n\nMicrowave the flask with agarose mixture for ~30 seconds.\n\nAlways watch for boiling. If mixture begins to bubble, remove it immediately and carefully swirl until bubbles are gone.\n\nWith hot mitt, remove the flask from microwave and gently swirl.\n\nBe careful—it will be hot! Hold the flask away from you and gently swirl to avoid splashing.\n\nReturn the flask to microwave and continue heating for another 30-40 seconds until mixture is clear and there are no agarose particles.\n\nAllow to cool.\n\nGently swirl while cooling. The solution should be cool enough to hold in the palm of your hand. This can take a couple minutes, please be patient.\n\nAdd GelRed:\n\nSmall gel: 6ul.\nMedium gel: 10 uL\n\nGelRed can be found in the drawer labeled “Lotterhos” in the shared wet lab/gel room.\n\nGently swirl until the stain is dissolved (you should not be able to see any red stain in the gel).\n\nPour the gel.\n\nUse masking tape to create walls on either side of the tray to contain the solution when poured. Test tape by filling tray with water first. Use multiple layers of tape to make sure it doesn’t leak. \n\nIf you are having issues with this method (leaks), you can set the gel in the rig if you flip the orientation of the tray so that it is confined. Make sure to wet the red rubber gaskets so that it is easier to take out after it has set. The rig needs to be empty for this method (no buffer in it). \n\nPour gel slowly to avoid bubbles.\n\nIf bubbles form, you can pop them using a pipette tip.\n\nAdd casting combs into the slots.\n\nThere are 2 pairs of combs for each size gel; one will create wider wells than the other. You can use either set of combs.\n\nRinse out the flask and hang on drying rack in Lotterhos lab.\n\nLet the gel set for ~40 minutes.\n\nThe gel should be solid, cool to the touch, and opaque.\nOnce gel is set, remove the tape and combs.\n\nRemove combs slowly, pulling straight up. It might be easier to do this if the gel is in the buffer.\n\n\nMake sure that the power source is off, and the gel rig is unplugged from the power source before removing the top.\nPlace the tray with your gel in the gel rig with wells on the side with the black plug\n\nSamples will run from the black side toward red side.\nDNA “runs to red” \n\nFill rig with enough 1X TAE Buffer to just cover the entire gel.\n\nThe rig doesn’t need to be filled all the way to the line, just enough to cover the gel.\n\nAdd ladder into the first well.\n\nMix 1ul ladder, 1ul TriTrack loading dye, and 4ul DI H20. Mix on parafilm or in a Qubit tube. Fill ladder wells with 3ul (half) of this mixture. Repeat or make a double batch depending on how many ladders you have.\n\nWe use the Generuler 1kb Plus DNA. Before pipetting, centrifuge the ladder briefly with the loading dye (for balance) so that there are no drips on the sides of the tubes.\nAliquots of ladder can be found in the -20 freezer. (we don’t have an aliquot right now, you might have to mix ladder/TriTrack/DIH20 yourself.\n\n\nLoad the gel.\n\nPlace the DNA samples on ice in the styrofoam box once they have defrosted.\nIf there is any gel inside the wells, clean them out by pipetting up TAE and expelling it into the wells\nCut a piece of parafilm and tape to benchtop. You can label it with sample names or well numbers if that’s helpful.\nUsing a pipette, add dots of 6X loading dye (1 for each sample) to parafilm. \n\nThe loading dye is blue and can be found in the -20 freezer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading DNA into gel wells\n\n\n\nRight before taking your 3ul of DNA, make sure to vortex the sample to ensure DNA is evenly dispersed throughout the tube. Forgetting to vortex can result in gels where no band is visible, or super streaky, as DNA may be stuck on the bottom of the sample well rather than suspended in the buffer.\n\n\nd.  Using a pipette **with filtered tips**, add DNA sample to a dot of loading dye.\n&lt;img width=\"460\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-03-24 at 2 55 12 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122108419/227614980-fc8435a5-46c8-47be-9839-8136d1aa8c28.png\"&gt;\n i. We use 3ul DNA + 1ul loading dye.\n \ne.  Mix by pipetting up and down slowly 3+ times.\n\nf.  Keep the same tip and pipette 3 ul of the dye/sample solution into the proper well of the gel.\n\ng.  Repeat for each sample\n    i. Change your pipette tip for each sample.\n    ii. Make sure to use new dot of dye for each sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPipetting into gel wells\n\n\n\nWhen pipetting into gel wells, be careful not to break the agarose or stick the pipette tip too far into the well so that the sample ejects into the agarose. Position your pipette tip just inside the well and check for dye in the correct well after you pipette it. Check to see if the agarose around the well breaks. Take a note if the agarose breaks around a well.

    "text": "Edit this page\nThe protocol for doing a magnetic bead wash.\n\n\n\nMagnetic beads are used for purification and size selection of single or double-stranded DNA. size selection may be performed at the following points during the overall library construction process:\n\nbefore or after DNA fragmentation;\nafter individual enzymatic reactions;\nafter the first post-ligation cleanup; or\nafter library amplification.\n\nWe use Kapa Pure Beads for magnetic bead washes. We find that they work as well as the Ampure Beads and are MUCH cheaper.\nBefore using, be sure to read the PDF from Kapa.\n\n\n\n\n\nClean up genomic DNA\nCleanup of fragmented DNA\nSize Selection\n\n\n\nFactors that Impact Overall Performance\n\n\n\n\nSee the PDF for the complete protocol. Tips:\n\n\n1.1 Ensure that KAPA Pure Beads has been equilibrated to room temperature and that the beads are fully resuspended before proceeding.\n1.2 Add 300 μL of KAPA Pure Beads (3:1 ratio for gDNA) to the 100 μL genomic DNA sample.\n1.3 Mix thoroughly by vortexing and/or pipetting up and down multiple times.\n1.4 Incubate the plate/tube(s) at room temperature for 10 min to bind the DNA to the beads.\n1.5 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture the beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear.\n1.6 Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.\n1.7 Keeping the plate/tube(s) on the magnet, add 200 μL of 80% ethanol.\n1.8 Incubate the plate/tube(s) on the magnet at room temperature for ≥30 sec.\n1.9 Carefully remove and discard the ethanol.\n1.10 Keeping the plate/tube(s) on the magnet, add 200 μL of 80% ethanol.\n1.11 Incubate the plate/tube(s) on the magnet at room temperature for ≥30 sec.\n1.12 Carefully remove and discard the ethanol. Try to remove all residual ethanol without disturbing the beads.\n1.13 Dry the beads at room temperature for 3 – 5 min, or until all of the ethanol has evaporated. Caution: over-drying the beads may result in reduced yield.\n1.14 Remove the plate/tube(s) from the magnet.\n1.15 Resuspend the beads in an appropriate volume of pre-heated elution buffer at 37°C and/or perform the elution incubation (step 1.16) in a thermocycler or heating block set to 37°C. The appropriate elution buffer may be either 10 mM Tris-HCl, (pH 8.0 – 8.5) or PCR-grade water, depending on the downstream application.\n1.16 Incubate the plate/tube(s) for 10 min to elute the DNA off the beads.\n1.17 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture the beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear.\n1.18 Transfer the clear supernatant to a new plate/ tube(s). Proceed with your downstream application, or store DNA at 4ºC for 1 – 2 weeks, or at -20ºC.\n\n\n\n\n3X KAPA Pure Beads to-sample volumetric ratio recommended\nThe detailed protocol below is an example of a 3X cleanup of genomic DNA in 100 µL. Please pay special attention to steps 1.15 and 1.16 (elution of DNA off beads). To ensure optimal recovery, these steps may be performed at an elevated temperature: 37°C for 10 min. Elution buffer may be pre-heated for this step and/or the elution performed in a thermocycler or heating block.\nAs indicated above, a heated elution is recommended to ensure optimal recovery of high-quality genomic DNA. This is not a requirement for the cleanup of other DNA types (e.g. fragmented DNA).\nFor maximum recovery of the original DNA sample during cleanup, buffer exchange, and/or concentration of genomic DNA, fragmented DNA for NGS library construction, PCR or qPCR products—regardless of quality—a KAPA Pure Beads-to-sample volumetric ratio of 3X is recommended. Expected recoveries are 50 – 90%, depending upon sample quality and quantity. If a lower ratio is used, it may result in lower yields and exclusion of smaller fragments.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1 Ensure that KAPA Pure Beads has been equilibrated to room temperature and that the beads are fully resuspended before proceeding.\n2.2 Add 80 μL of KAPA Pure Beads to the 100 μL fragmented DNA sample.\n2.3 Mix thoroughly by vortexing and/or pipetting up and down multiple times.\n2.4 Incubate the plate/tube(s) at room temperature for 5 – 15 min to bind the DNA to the beads.\n2.5 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture the beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear.\n2.6 Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.\n2.7 Keeping the plate/tube(s) on the magnet, add 200 μL of 80% ethanol.\n2.8 Incubate the plate/tube(s) on the magnet at room temperature for ≥30 sec.\n2.9 Carefully remove and discard the ethanol.\n2.10 Keeping the plate/tube(s) on the magnet, add 200 μL of 80% ethanol.\n2.11 Incubate the plate/tube(s) on the magnet at room temperature for ≥30 sec.\n2.12 Carefully remove and discard the ethanol. Try to remove all residual ethanol without disturbing the beads.\n2.13 Dry the beads at room temperature for 3 – 5 min, or until all of the ethanol has evaporated. Caution: over-drying the beads may result in reduced yield.\n2.14 Remove the plate/tube(s) from the magnet.\n2.15 Resuspend the beads in an appropriate volume of elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 – 8.5) or PCR-grade water, depending on the downstream application.\n2.16 Incubate the plate/tube(s) at room temperature for 2 min to elute the DNA off the beads. The elution time may be extended up to 10 min if necessary to improve DNA recovery.\n2.17 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture the beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear.\n2.18 Transfer the clear supernatant to a new plate/ tube(s). Proceed with your downstream application, or store DNA at 4ºC for 1 – 2 weeks, or at -20ºC.\n\n\n\n0.8X cleanup of a 100 µL fragmented DNA sample recommended (will retain fragments greater than 300 bp)\n\n\n\n\nFragments to be retained\nRecommended Beads-to-sample ratio\n\n\n\n\n≥ kb\n0.5X\n\n\n≥ 450 bp\n0.6X\n\n\n≥ 350 bp\n0.7X\n\n\n≥ 300 bp\n0.8X\n\n\n≥ 250 bp\n0.9X\n\n\n≥ 150 bp\n1.5X\n\n\n≥ 100 bp\n2.2X -3X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1 Ensure that KAPA Pure Beads has been equilibrated to room temperature and that the beads are fully resuspended before proceeding.\n3.2 Perform the first size cut (0.6X, to exclude large library fragments) by adding 30 μL of KAPA Pure Beads to 50 μL of adapter-ligated library (0.6 x 50 μL = 30 μL).\n3.3 Mix thoroughly by vortexing and/or pipetting up and down multiple times.\n3.4 Incubate the plate/tube(s) at room temperature for 5 – 15 min to bind large library molecules (&gt;450 bp) to the beads.\n3.5 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture the beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear.\n3.6 Carefully transfer the supernatant containing the smaller library molecules (&lt;450 bp) to a new plate/ tube(s). It is critical that no beads are transferred with the supernatant.\n3.7 Discard the plate/tube(s) containing the beads to which library fragments larger than ~450 bp are bound.\n3.8 Perform the second size cut (0.8X) by adding 10 μL of KAPA Pure Beads to the supernatant. This volume is calculated relative to the original sample volume of 50 μL, e.g., (0.8 – 0.6) x 50 μL = 10 μL.\n3.9 Mix thoroughly by vortexing and/or pipetting up and down multiple times.\n3.10 Incubate the plate/tube(s) at room temperature for 5 – 15 min to bind library molecules &gt;250 bp to the beads.\n3.11 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture the beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant which contains library molecules smaller than\n\n250 bp.\n\n3.12 Keeping the plate/tube(s) on the magnet, add 200 μL of 80% ethanol.\n3.13 Incubate the plate/tube(s) on the magnet at room temperature for ≥30 sec.\n3.14 Carefully remove and discard the ethanol. 3.15 Keeping the plate/tube(s) on the magnet, add 200 μL of 80% ethanol.\n3.16 Incubate the plate/tube(s) on the magnet at room temperature for ≥30 sec.\n3.17 Carefully remove and discard the ethanol. Try to remove all residual ethanol without disturbing the beads.\n3.18 Dry the beads at room temperature for 3 – 5 min, or until all of the ethanol has evaporated. ⚠️ Caution: over-drying the beads may result in reduced yield.\n3.19 Remove the plate/tube(s) from the magnet.\n3.20 Thoroughly resuspend the beads in the required volume of elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 – 8.5), or PCR-grade water, depending on the downstream application.\n3.21 Incubate the plate/tube(s) at room temperature for 2 min to elute DNA off the beads. The elution time may be extended up to 10 min if necessary to improve DNA recovery.\n3.22 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture the beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear.\n3.23 Transfer the clear supernatant with size-selected DNA to a new plate/tube(s). Proceed with your downstream application, or store DNA at 4ºC for 1 – 2 weeks, or at -20ºC.\n\n\nBead-based size selection or “double-sided size selection” consists of a “first” and “second cut”, represented as ratios of beads-to-sample volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\nStore at 2°C to 8°C in a constant-temperature refrigerator; do not store at -20°C. Always ensure that KAPA Pure Beads is fully equilibrated to room temperature before use.\nFor optimal performance, always ensure that the KAPA Pure Beads is equilibrated to room temperature, that the beads are fully resuspended before use, and that the DNA and bead solutions are thoroughly mixed prior to the binding incubation.\nThe volumetric ratio of KAPA Pure Beads to sample is the critical factor in determining the size distribution of DNA fragments retained by the beads. The volume (ratio) may be modified/optimized based upon the specific application and/or point in the library construction workflow where a cleanup or size selection is employed.\nThe volume in which cleanups and size selection are performed may impact performance. DNA samples may be diluted in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 – 8.5) or PCR-grade water to increase the working volume prior to the addition of KAPA Pure Beads. This is recommended for starting volumes &lt;50 µL, DNA preparations that are viscous, and/ or contain a high concentration of salts or PEG.\nIt is important to prepare fresh 80% ethanol prior to use, since ethanol absorbs atmospheric water.\nThe volume of 80% ethanol used for bead washes may be adjusted to accommodate different plate/tube volumes and/or limited pipetting capacity, but it is important that the beads are entirely submerged during the wash steps. Where possible, use a wash volume that is equal to the volume of sample plus KAPA Pure Beads.\nIt is important to remove all ethanol before proceeding with subsequent reactions. However, over-drying of beads may make them difficult to resuspend, and may result in a dramatic loss of DNA. Drying of beads for 3 – 5 min at room temperature should be sufficient. Drying of beads at 37ºC is not recommended.\nElution time and temperature may impact DNA recovery, particularly for high-molecular weight genomic DNA.\nPurified DNA in elution buffer should be stable at 4°C for 1 – 2 weeks, or for at least 1 month at -20°C. The long-term stability of library DNA at -20°C depends on a number of factors, including library concentration. Always use low DNA-binding tubes for long-term storage and avoid excessive freezing and thawing.\nTo increase the recovery of DNA at a specific stage in an NGS library construction protocol, the volume of KAPA Pure Beads used in the cleanup may be increased, but this will most likely result in the retention of smaller DNA fragments.\n\n\n\n\nIncrease upper size limit: Decrease the ratio of the first cut\nDecrease upper size limit: Increase the ratio of the first cut\n\n\n\n\n\nIncrease lower size limit: Decrease the ratio of the second cut\nDecrease lower size limit: Increase the ratio of the second cut\nThe second size cut should be performed with at least 0.2 volumes of KAPA Pure Beads. Please note the volume of the KAPA Pure Beads needed for the second cut is calculated relative to the volume of the sample at the start of the size selection procedure, not the volume of the DNA-containing supernatant transferred after the first cut. DNA recovery is dramatically reduced if the difference between the first and second cuts is less than ~0.2  volumes. To increase the amount of DNA recovered, more than 0.2 volumes of KAPA Pure Beads may be used for the second cut, but note that this may result in the recovery of smaller library fragments and a broader size distribution.",

Always use low DNA-binding tubes for long-term storage and avoid excessive freezing and thawing.\nTo increase the recovery of DNA at a specific stage in an NGS library construction protocol, the volume of KAPA Pure Beads used in the cleanup may be increased, but this will most likely result in the retention of smaller DNA fragments.\n\n\n\n\nIncrease upper size limit: Decrease the ratio of the first cut\nDecrease upper size limit: Increase the ratio of the first cut\n\n\n\n\n\nIncrease lower size limit: Decrease the ratio of the second cut\nDecrease lower size limit: Increase the ratio of the second cut\nThe second size cut should be performed with at least 0.2 volumes of KAPA Pure Beads. Please note the volume of the KAPA Pure Beads needed for the second cut is calculated relative to the volume of the sample at the start of the size selection procedure, not the volume of the DNA-containing supernatant transferred after the first cut. DNA recovery is dramatically reduced if the difference between the first and second cuts is less than ~0.2  volumes. To increase the amount of DNA recovered, more than 0.2 volumes of KAPA Pure Beads may be used for the second cut, but note that this may result in the recovery of smaller library fragments and a broader size distribution.",

    "text": "install iTerm terminal app for MacOS\nEdit this page\nThese instructions will instruct users on how to install iTerm terminal app for MacOS and further install iTerm’s “shell integration”.\niTerm2 is a program that allows you to have a command-line interface with the computer. Generally this type of program is called a ‘terminal’. Mac has a native Terminal app, but iTerm has more bells and whistles. The terminal is used to run programs (or custom scripts) “manually”.\n\n\n1. download iTerm\nFirst, download and install iTerm2 (if you haven’t already). https://iterm2.com\n\n\n2. install shell integration\nOnce the program is installed, we’ll want to install a feature called “shell integration”. There are some cool features that this allows, like viewing pdfs/images in the command line, right-click to download and a few other useful ones too (more info here). To do this, open iTerm2, then in menubar Shell &gt; New Window. Then go to the menubar again and iTerm2 &gt; Install Shell Integration.\n\nThe next window you want to check the box for “Allow install iTerm2 Utilities”.\nThen click Download and Run Installer (+ continue)\nDone!\nNote that we just installed shell integration for your local laptop. For shell integration to work on other servers, you’ll need to be ssh-ed to the server and then go to the menubar again and iTerm2 &gt; Install Shell Integration.\n\nOnce complete, it should print a bunch of information to the terminal window. At the end, it will list all of the new tools you can use and how to use them. For some, you only enter the tool name and hit enter to use it in command-line (imgls), while others it shows you you need another word after the tool name (it2dl [filename]) before the tool will work. Each tool also has an indented description of what it does.If you can ssh to Discovery (or other servers) you’ll need to install shell integration with each server.\n\nFor shell integration and the new tools to work, you will need to either start a new session (e.g., open a new terminal tab +/- ssh) or source $HOME/.bash_profile. Doing either option will execute the commands added to your $HOME/.bash_profile file by iTerm. if you vim $HOME/.bash_profile you should see something like this:\ntest -e \"${HOME}/.iterm2_shell_integration.bash\" && source \"${HOME}/.iterm2_shell_integration.bash\"",

    "text": "Edit this page\n\nThe average time it takes to publish a paper after you first submit it for review is 6-9 months. Each round of review takes 1-4 months, each round of revisions take 1-2 months, and then it can take a month or more to get the proofs and approve the final version for publication. Plan accordingly. If I want a paper published in a particular calendar year, I try to get it submitted by March.\nRead this great ariticle with tips from a famous fiction author on how to write a great paper\n\n\nWriting has two facets: building good writing habits and actually putting words together in a way that makes sense to other people. Knowing the difference between e.g. and i.e. saves your co-authors time explaining it to you. Grammatical errors frustrate reviewers and panelists, and make them skeptical of attention to detail and the quality of the work.\n\nCheck out this Nature article “Kick-Start Writing”\n\n\n\n\nOn our Professional Development page there is some information on how we use the Vancouver Protocol to determine authorship.\nSee also https://www.elsevier.com/researcher/author/policies-and-guidelines/credit-author-statement\n\n\n\nWriting Your Dissertation in 15min/day\nHow to Write Alot\n\n\n\n\n\nStyle: the elements of clarity and grace\nFunk and White\n\n\n\n\n\nThis timeline assumes you have a full rough draft 3 months before a deadline. Prior to this time, make sure you have a target journal and stay within the word limit as you write.\n\nWeek -12: Rough draft ready. A rough draft should not be missing many citations, and should have near-final versions of all the figures and tables.\nWeek -9 to -10: Meeting with co-authors to go over current draft of manuscript, approve methods, decide what figures to include, etc. Keep in mind this meeting could take a couple of weeks to get on the books (so should be planned in week -11).\nWeek -8: Full draft ready, with high quality figures. Make sure this draft is formatted for submission (e.g. word counts, figure number, etc.).\nWeek - 6 to 7: Two weeks for comments from co-authors. Continue to improve manuscript while waiting for comments.\nWeek -5: Incorporate comments from co-authors. Plan another meeting with co-authors if needed.\nWeek - 4: Make sure final draft is formatted for submission (e.g. word counts, figure number, etc.)\nWeek -2 to -3: Two weeks for final comments from all co-authors.\nWeek -1: Fine editing, grammar, figure references, bibliography edits. Leave 2-3 hours for submission.\n\n\n\n\nEvery manuscript typically has 3 parts that I submit, the text of the manuscript (written collaboratively in google docs), the figures with legends (in latex), and the supplement (in latex). I use LaTex for figures and supplements because it makes them high quality, and is easier to control the size of the figures as they are displayed on the page.\n\n\nHere is a link to a template, with important things to remember about writing * Having links to relevant documents at the top of the manuscript can be helpful, including a link to the editor letter, response to reviewers, notes and unused text, etc.\n\nGoogle docs offers a platform for collaboration that does not involve emailing each other many versions, which is inefficient. All changes are available immediately to everyone. It also has a good version control system (Click on “All changes saved in Drive”). I use this system to name specific drafts that I may want to go back to.\n\nUse “Outlines”. Labeling different sections with headers and sub-headers will automatically create an outline. “View —&gt; Show Document Outline” can make it fast to navigate.\n\nHave a separate document for notes, logs, deleted text, and posting old versions of the figures or trial versions of figures.\nMake sure to use text to create tables, because typesetters will not be happy if you create images or LaTeX tables\nI like to have a shared folder with pdfs of all the references\nHave a target journal and stay within the word limit as you write.\n\n\n\n\n\nA good way to frustrate reviewers is to submit high resolution figures in an online system that appends them to the end of your manuscript with no Figure ID or legend.\nTo make my reviewer’s life easier, I use LaTeX to create on figures document with figure legends on the same page as the figures. When the final (final) document is accepted for publication, then I just upload the high resolution figures. Template\nIt will be important to double check that the Figure Legends in the Manuscript match the Figure Legends in the LaTeX document\n\n\n\n\n\nI use the same LaTex template to produce high-quality Supplementary Materials. Template\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI use the ICMJE Vancouver Protocol. It is important to run this by all authors at the beginning of a collaboration, and again at publication.\n\n\n\n\n\nAddons –&gt; Get add ons –&gt; search for Paperpile\nIt works best when you search for the webpage or the title of the paper.\nThis system is more efficient than keeping EndNote on your computer, where you have to download the citation and then add it to EndNote to cite it in a word processor.\nAt the bottom of the app is an “Open Paperpile” link, which provides some extra functionality\nTo add all your citations in a document to Paperpile, you can click on a reference in the Bibliography, click “Open”, then click on “View all references from this Document”, then in the upper right hand corner click on the icon and “Add all references to my library”\n\n\n\n\n\nSet aside 15 minutes first thing every morning to engage with the manuscript.\nCreate an outline (through discussions with all authors) and stick to it\nStart with methods, and be sure to update them every time you do the actual method. It is important to be as specific as possible (e.g. kit manufacturer, name of the piece of equipment you used) to ensure the results are reproducible.\nA well-framed research question should allow you to write the introduction before the results are known. In the Introduction you should lay out the rationale for the study, including the questions or hypotheses to be addressed.\nI find it helpful to draw text from the papers I am citing or reading if I get stuck in a writing block, and then going back to edit it later.\nAs you start to work on a section, the most important thing is to maintain communication and discussions with all authors, especially if what you write strays from the outline. You may be wasting effort and taking the manuscript in a direction that is different from what others envision.\nAdding comments to sections that you are working on and how you plan to improve them, or questions you have on how to improve them, can help co-authors understand where your thought process is.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery detail matters. Be prepared to spend 4-8 hours or more refining a figure, even after you get a general figure that everyone agrees on.\n\nCommon mistakes:\n\nAll axes labels are centered. There are no redundant axis labels in multi-panel plots.\ny-axis tick labels are not sideways\nThe color pattern works in B&W and for color blind. There are color-blind palettes in R, and there are websites online where you can see how your figure works for a color blind person.\nNo 3-D plots.\ny-axis scale does not accentuate differences in the effect size (in other words not zoomed in)\nBase R plotting options:\n\nbty = \"l\" box type is “L” shaped and not a square outline\nlas = 1 y-axis tick labels are upright\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare the google doc with co-authors and colleagues for feedback. It can take a couple weeks to get it back from them, and don’t be afraid to follow up if they are taking too long. After that it can take a few or several weeks to make edits and changes. While you are waiting on them, you can work on some of the points below.\n\n\n\n\nThe final stages prior to submission can take about a month or more.\n\nI like to go through all the references in my folder and skim them over again. As I read them over, I double check that they are cited correctly, and often I find other places to cite them, which helps to weave common threads throughout. Especially if I am first author, I want to be familiar with the papers that others cited but I haven’t read before. This process takes me a couple weeks of 4-5 hours per day.\nWrite your letter to the editor. Template\nCheck the author guidelines for the journal you are submitting to and make sure all sections of the manuscript fit those guidelines.\nIn the “Data Accessibility” section I often put “All datasets and scripts used to create results will be archived on Dryad upon final acceptance of the manuscript. Scripts can currently be seen at the github site XXXX.” (Beware if double blind review, you may not want to put the github site)\nDo not count on co-authors to find mistakes and grammatical errors. I have read over manuscripts 10+ times and there are still errors.\nEdit for unneccessary words or long sentences.\nAttention to detail is paramount. Every error that a reviewer finds is a mental check that other important details may have been overlooked in the research.\nWriting Author Contributions. Communication here is paramount. It can help to send this list to each author and let them tell you where they think they should have their initials by. See also https://www.elsevier.com/researcher/author/policies-and-guidelines/credit-author-statement Who:\n\nConceptualized and administered the project,\nObtained funding\nDeveloped methods\nCollected data\nDid the formal analysis\nVisualized the data\nWrote the software\nPerformed data curation\nWrote the original draft of the manuscript\nAll authors reviewed and edited the manuscript.\n\nBe sure to have page and line numbers. There is an “Line Numbers for Google Docs Add On”\nEdit all references in the Bibliography (this is the very last thing you do). Paperpile often has errors, especially with capitalization. You do not want to have a reviewer find their name was spelled wrong in your reference list, so check also for special characters. Species italics is another thing that often needs to be edited.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to submission, get final approval (in writing) from all authors and agreement that all authors are accountable for mistakes or errors per ICJMES policy.\nWhen I first started submitting manuscripts, I had to go through multiple attempts because I kept making edits or changes to the manuscript. Just wait until everything is perfect and do it once.\nI like to submit the figures and their legends together in the word doc at the end, where reviewers can find them. I will also submit the pdfs of the figures seperately if they want to see the high quality versions.\nAfter you submit, name your draft in google drive. (Click on “All changes saved in Drive”). Save the draft as a Word Document, which will be used below if a “track changes” document is needed in the response to reviews.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour baseline expectation should be a rejection with extensive comments from reviewers.\nInvolve all authors in responding to reviews, communication is important here. Take every review seriously, even if they are being ridiculous. A good editor will emphasize the good reviews and de-emphasize the ridiculous ones.\nBe respectful when responding to reviews, and be sure to note which comments were helpful. Also be sure to note where there is disagreement among reviewers when responding to comments.\nBe sure to acknowledge the Editor and anonymous reviewers in your “Acknowledgments” section\nIt is good to submit a “track changes” document. Microsoft word has a great system for comparing 2 documents. After all authors approve the final revisions with all changes accepted, export the manuscript to .docx. In Word, go to “Tools –&gt; Track Changes –&gt; Compare Documents”. Upload the draft that was submitted the first time around. Word will produce a document showing all changes between the two documents, which you can submit with your review.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead them\nWait 2 days\nSchedule regular meetings with your co-authors to develop consensus on how to respond to comments\nCreate a folder for the response to reviews. This folder will hold the edited figure files, compared documents, manuscript and new cover letter. I like to number my figures “F1” “F2” etc. I like to name my folder “YYYYMMDD JournalName Revisions”\nMake sure to save the first version as a word file before you start. This will be used for compare documents.\nTo avoid cognitive load of multiple documents, I work in one Google Doc with Sections (Reviewer comment, letter to editor, title page, manuscript, etc). Set each section to start on it’s own page numbering and line numbering.\nCopy the whole shebang including the editor’s decision and paste it into reviewer comments section of the google doc\nPut all the reviewer comments as comments at the relevant line numbers in the manuscript - don’t make any edits yet or you will screw up the line numbers! Draft responses as you do this and number the responses.\nAs you make edits, you can track changes and accept them as needed to keep the document clean. You will use “compare docs” in Word at the end to show the editor where the revisions are made, so you don’t have to work in a messy manuscript now.\nFor each response that is more than a minor edit, make sure to copy the edited text in the main document. This step is important because it lowers the cognitive load for editors and reviewers, who will not need to scour the document to understand your edits. You do not need to cite the new line numbers for your revisions, just cite the section and paste in the new text. Examples:\n\nL22-24. “Although genomic forecasting methods are becoming more accessible, evaluating their limitations in a particular study system requires careful planning and experimentation. Meticulously designed evaluation experiments can reveal the limitations of forecasts” These two sentences are repetitive. \nResponse 8: The second sentence was edited to state: “Meticulously designed evaluation experiments can clarify the robustness of the forecasts for application in management”\nL62 and L69. I’m a bit uncomfortable with the use of the term “ground-truth measures of fitness” because, as well explained in Element 2, fitness can only be estimated or approximated with proxies. Therefore, I would use instead either “ground-truth data” or “fitness proxies based on ground-truth data”.\nResponse 22: This point is well received. This section now reads (edits underlined): “However, only a few of these studies have actually evaluated those forecasts in experiments with ground-truth data(Exposito-Alonso et al., 2019; Fitzpatrick et al., 2021; Gain et al., 2023; Lind et al., 2024; Rhoné et al., 2020). The definition of ground-truth data is data that is known to be real or true, provided by direct and accurate measurement (in situ). Within the field of genomic forecasting, the ground-truth data should estimate the fitness in a specific environment or a fitness offset between two environments. Fitness can be estimated from the product of viability (survival) and fecundity(Conner & Hartl, 2004), but these can be difficult to measure. Instead, proxies of fitness such as growth rate or size are often used as ground-truth data (see Element 2 for discussion). For a study to qualify as a ground-truth experiment, the genomic forecasts are evaluated against ground-truth proxies of fitness collected from multiple individuals or populations in one or more common garden environments.”\n\nFor majorly revised figures show the old version and the new version in the responses. This step is important because it lowers the cognitive load for editors and reviewers, who will not need to scour the document to see the new version.\nUse kind language for constructive comments, e.g. “We agreed”, “we thank the reviewer”, “express our appreciation”, “this is a good suggestion”, “this point is well received”, etc.\nRe-read the entire manuscript from start to finish\nOnce co-authors sign off, accept all the edits, delete all the comments, and output to a word file. Use “compare documents” in Word to get all the changes from the first version.\nKeep the figures with their legends at the end of the document where reviewers can find them. I also upload the high-quality pdfs of figures for review.\nMake sure to thank the editor and reviewers in the Acknowledgements section\n\nExample doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yTJnATJFoVoqvROZ4vOJeEPbnmybR0cyCgKrKCLbblM/edit#heading=h.jj7mh0obo2p6 Ask Katie for access\n\n\n\n\nArchiving data and scripts on Dryad. Ensure that the scripts are still reproducible by running them on your computer and someone else’s. Once you upload to Dryad, that’s it - you can’t go back and edit or change something.\n\nDryad has specific instructions for compressing and transferring large files, so initiate communication with them before you start this process. Make sure everything is perfect, then compress the folder with all data and scripts per Dryad instructions.\nThe process of getting a DOI can take about a week. After you get the DOI, add the data citation to your Bibliography per Dryad instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you receive the proofs, you typically have 48 hours to make corrections and send them back. It is good to share with co-authors if they have the time, but typically it is up to the first author to make corrections.\nRead through the entire proofs, and don’t just focus on the questions from the typesetters. There will still be mistakes and grammatical errors to be found.\n\n\n\n\n\nCelebrate!",

    "text": "Read them\nWait 2 days\nSchedule regular meetings with your co-authors to develop consensus on how to respond to comments\nCreate a folder for the response to reviews. This folder will hold the edited figure files, compared documents, manuscript and new cover letter. I like to number my figures “F1” “F2” etc. I like to name my folder “YYYYMMDD JournalName Revisions”\nMake sure to save the first version as a word file before you start. This will be used for compare documents.\nTo avoid cognitive load of multiple documents, I work in one Google Doc with Sections (Reviewer comment, letter to editor, title page, manuscript, etc). Set each section to start on it’s own page numbering and line numbering.\nCopy the whole shebang including the editor’s decision and paste it into reviewer comments section of the google doc\nPut all the reviewer comments as comments at the relevant line numbers in the manuscript - don’t make any edits yet or you will screw up the line numbers! Draft responses as you do this and number the responses.\nAs you make edits, you can track changes and accept them as needed to keep the document clean. You will use “compare docs” in Word at the end to show the editor where the revisions are made, so you don’t have to work in a messy manuscript now.\nFor each response that is more than a minor edit, make sure to copy the edited text in the main document. This step is important because it lowers the cognitive load for editors and reviewers, who will not need to scour the document to understand your edits. You do not need to cite the new line numbers for your revisions, just cite the section and paste in the new text. Examples:\n\nL22-24. “Although genomic forecasting methods are becoming more accessible, evaluating their limitations in a particular study system requires careful planning and experimentation. Meticulously designed evaluation experiments can reveal the limitations of forecasts” These two sentences are repetitive. \nResponse 8: The second sentence was edited to state: “Meticulously designed evaluation experiments can clarify the robustness of the forecasts for application in management”\nL62 and L69. I’m a bit uncomfortable with the use of the term “ground-truth measures of fitness” because, as well explained in Element 2, fitness can only be estimated or approximated with proxies. Therefore, I would use instead either “ground-truth data” or “fitness proxies based on ground-truth data”.\nResponse 22: This point is well received. This section now reads (edits underlined): “However, only a few of these studies have actually evaluated those forecasts in experiments with ground-truth data(Exposito-Alonso et al., 2019; Fitzpatrick et al., 2021; Gain et al., 2023; Lind et al., 2024; Rhoné et al., 2020). The definition of ground-truth data is data that is known to be real or true, provided by direct and accurate measurement (in situ). Within the field of genomic forecasting, the ground-truth data should estimate the fitness in a specific environment or a fitness offset between two environments. Fitness can be estimated from the product of viability (survival) and fecundity(Conner & Hartl, 2004), but these can be difficult to measure. Instead, proxies of fitness such as growth rate or size are often used as ground-truth data (see Element 2 for discussion). For a study to qualify as a ground-truth experiment, the genomic forecasts are evaluated against ground-truth proxies of fitness collected from multiple individuals or populations in one or more common garden environments.”\n\nFor majorly revised figures show the old version and the new version in the responses. This step is important because it lowers the cognitive load for editors and reviewers, who will not need to scour the document to see the new version.\nUse kind language for constructive comments, e.g. “We agreed”, “we thank the reviewer”, “express our appreciation”, “this is a good suggestion”, “this point is well received”, etc.\nRe-read the entire manuscript from start to finish\nOnce co-authors sign off, accept all the edits, delete all the comments, and output to a word file. Use “compare documents” in Word to get all the changes from the first version.\nKeep the figures with their legends at the end of the document where reviewers can find them. I also upload the high-quality pdfs of figures for review.\nMake sure to thank the editor and reviewers in the Acknowledgements section\n\nExample doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yTJnATJFoVoqvROZ4vOJeEPbnmybR0cyCgKrKCLbblM/edit#heading=h.jj7mh0obo2p6 Ask Katie for access",

    "text": "Edit this page\n\n\n\nThe qPCR machine is located in the Bowen Lab. Please coordinate with their lab before using the machine. This protocol is used to quantify the amount of each of your libraries that will be sequenced by the sequencer. Quantifying by other means will tell you how much dsDNA you have in your library, but the qPCR will tell you how much library was successfully amplified and how much will be read by the sequencer. You should run each sample in triplicate on the qPCR to minimize error in these measurements especially when pooling samples for sequencing.\n\n\n\n\nKit: KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Universal) (Cat #: KK4923)\nSpecific strip tubes & caps: Agilent AriaMx 96 Tube Strips (Cat #: ) & Agilent Optical Cap, 8x Strip (Cat #: )\nMake a stock of 10 mM Tris-HCl + 0.05% Tween-20 (optional but recommended for the dilution of library DNA, as it leads to improved accuracy by reducing the adherence of DNA to plastic surfaces)\nCopy of KAPA Protocol Found here\nEnsure qPCR reagents are thawed and properly mixed. If the kit is new, the 2X KAPA SYBR-FAST qPCR Master Mix (5mL) should be combined with 1 mL 10X Illumina Primer Premix and then aliquoted out. These should be labeled with the date it was mixed because once mixed the reagent is only good for (60 days double check that timeframe).\n1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube per library\nPreviously quantified libraries and their concentrations\nTurn on qPCR machine (needs some time to warm up so turn on before you start setting up your reactions)\n\n\n\n\n\nLibraries need to be diluted to be read on the QPCR machine. All dilutions should be done in 10 mM Tris-HCl + 0.05% Tween-20. First dilute sample to a 1:1000 concentration in a 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube (Table 1).\n\n\n\nReagent | Amount | |———————————|———| | 10 mM Tris-HCl + 0.05% Tween-20 | 999 uL | | Library dsDNA | 1 uL | | Total | 1000 uL |\n\n\n\nReagent\nAmount\n\n\n\n\n10 mM Tris-HCl + 0.05% Tween-20\n999 uL\n\n\nLibrary dsDNA\n1 uL\n\n\nTotal\n1000 uL\n\n\n\n\nNext dilute your sample libraries to ensure they fall within the range of the standards provided by the KAPA kit (Table 2). Typically for a library in the range of 1-200 ng/uL you need a 1:18000 dilution to be read on the QPCR machine. However, you can use the calculation below to determine what you need to dilute your undiluted library down to:\n\n\n\n\n\nCalc 1: (Undiluted Library Conc. (ng/uL)/ (617.9 g/mol * fragment size of library)) * 10^6 = undiluted library in nM\nCalc 2: undiluted library in nM * 1000 = undiluted library in pM\nCalc 3: dilute final library to be in the range of the standards in Table 2\n\n\n\n\n| Standard Name | dsDNA concentration (pM) | |—————|————————–| | Standard 1 | 20 | | Standard 2 | 2 | | Standard 3 | 0.2 | | Standard 4 | 0.02 | | Standard 5 | 0.002 | | Standard 6 | 0.0002 |\n\n\n\n\n\nqPCR reactions for the six standards and each library dilution should be set up in triplicate. Load each well of the qPCR strip tubes as indicated below in Table 3, for a total reaction volume of 20 uL. Below is an example set up when running 8 libraries in triplicate (Table 4).\nNote: you can not label the individual tubes. Make sure you pay attention to your strip tube orientation and order. Tip: Always put the “A” side of strip tude on top and label each strip tube tap with the numbers 1 - # of strip tubes. Have a key in your notebook to what each of those strips contain. When you are doing a lot of these it is easy to mix up what was in what tube.\nNote: mix contents of each reaction very well by pipetting up and down ~20 times.\n\n\n\n| Reagent | Amount | |—————————————————|——–| | KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix containing Primers | 12 uL | | PCR-grade water | 4 uL | | Diluted dsDNA library dsDNA Standard (1-6) | 4 uL | | Total | 20 uL |\n\n\n\n| | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | |—|——|——|——|——-|——-|——-| | A | Std1 | Std1 | Std1 | Samp1 | Samp1 | Samp1 | | B | Std2 | Std2 | Std2 | Samp2 | Samp2 | Samp2 | | C | Std3 | Std3 | Std3 | Samp3 | Samp3 | Samp3 | | D | Std4 | Std4 | Std4 | Samp4 | Samp4 | Samp4 | | E | Std5 | Std5 | Std5 | Samp5 | Samp5 | Samp5 | | F | Std6 | Std6 | Std6 | Samp6 | Samp6 | Samp6 | | G | Blk | Blk | Blk | Samp7 | Samp7 | Samp7 | | H | | | | Samp8 | Samp8 | Samp8 |\n\nEnsure that the qPCR plate is sealed.\nCollect all components in the bottom of the well by brief centrifucation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake final reaction strip tubes to the Bowen lab for use on the qPCR machine.\nTurn on the power button in the bottom left hand corner. This will take a few minutes because the machine runs self diagnostics when booting up.\nOn the home screen, click “Quantitative PCR Fluoresence Probe”\n\n\n\nThe first screen that will pop up is your plate set up. Here click the top left corner of the plate to select all wells and in the bottom right corner change the dye from “FAM” to “SYBR”. This updates all wells to have the correct dye information for your run.\n\n\n\nNext for each well make sure to label as either a “Standard” well, “NTC” (no template control) well, or “Unknown” well. For example, to do this for standards, highlight all cells that are locations of standards and move to the top right corner dropdown menu called “Well Types” and set it to standard. You can click and drag to highlight multiple locations in a row or just click on all the cells individually. You can always deselect by clicking that cell again or deselect everything using the top left corner square.\n\n\n\nNext click on the left tab that says “Thermal Profile” and set the specifications for your run (Table 5). You do this by clicking any value (e.g., time or temperature) and manually editing the values as shown in the image below.\n\n\n\n\n| Step | Temperature | Time | Cycles | |————————————–|————-|——–|——–| | Initial activation/denaturation | 95C | 5 min | 1 | | Denaturation | 95C | 30 sec | 35 | | Annealing/extension/data acquisition | 60C | 45 sec | * |\nThe denature and annealing steps are both run together for 35 cycles. Markdown tables are frustrating and you can’t merge cells of a table. See the image at the bottom of this section for clarification. Once the specifications are set properly, place the tubes in the qPCR machine and click “Run Experiment”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo analyze the output you have to use the AriaMx program located on the Bowen laptop that is typically plugged into the tapestation in the Shared Molecular Space.\nFirst use the red flash drive (pictured below) to get your data off of the qPCR machine. Only this flash drive works (not sure why?).\n\n\n\nThen shut down the qPCR machine and take the flash drive to the tapestation computer. Here you should open the Agilent Aria program to see your data.\n\n\n\nOnce the program opens a similar table to what you saw on the qPCR machine will open. Standard cells will be a redish pink color, sample cells blue and no template control green. For the standard cells you need to manually enter each value into the program. This is done by highlighting one cell and moving to the properties tab on the right side panel. Then in the standard quantities section place the value of that standard in the “Amount” field and change the Units field to picograms. These values will correspond to the order you put your ladder in and are the values in Table 2. Double check all inputs once you complete all your standard wells then you are ready to view your results.\n\n\n\nHighlight all cells then move to the “Graphical Displays” to inspect your amplification plots and where your samples fall on your standard curve. You can do a visual inspection here to ensure your samples fall within your standards, but you need to export your Cq values to determine actually concentrations of your samples.\n\n\n\nTo export your Cq values make sure all samples are highlighted in the right hand column. Right click and select “export to excel”. Save your excel file to a hard drive and take it to your personal computer.",

This will take a few minutes because the machine runs self diagnostics when booting up.\nOn the home screen, click “Quantitative PCR Fluoresence Probe”\n\n\n\nThe first screen that will pop up is your plate set up. Here click the top left corner of the plate to select all wells and in the bottom right corner change the dye from “FAM” to “SYBR”. This updates all wells to have the correct dye information for your run.\n\n\n\nNext for each well make sure to label as either a “Standard” well, “NTC” (no template control) well, or “Unknown” well. For example, to do this for standards, highlight all cells that are locations of standards and move to the top right corner dropdown menu called “Well Types” and set it to standard. You can click and drag to highlight multiple locations in a row or just click on all the cells individually. You can always deselect by clicking that cell again or deselect everything using the top left corner square.\n\n\n\nNext click on the left tab that says “Thermal Profile” and set the specifications for your run (Table 5). You do this by clicking any value (e.g., time or temperature) and manually editing the values as shown in the image below.\n\n\n\n\n| Step | Temperature | Time | Cycles | |————————————–|————-|——–|——–| | Initial activation/denaturation | 95C | 5 min | 1 | | Denaturation | 95C | 30 sec | 35 | | Annealing/extension/data acquisition | 60C | 45 sec | * |\nThe denature and annealing steps are both run together for 35 cycles. Markdown tables are frustrating and you can’t merge cells of a table. See the image at the bottom of this section for clarification.

Only this flash drive works (not sure why?).\n\n\n\nThen shut down the qPCR machine and take the flash drive to the tapestation computer. Here you should open the Agilent Aria program to see your data.\n\n\n\nOnce the program opens a similar table to what you saw on the qPCR machine will open. Standard cells will be a redish pink color, sample cells blue and no template control green. For the standard cells you need to manually enter each value into the program. This is done by highlighting one cell and moving to the properties tab on the right side panel. Then in the standard quantities section place the value of that standard in the “Amount” field and change the Units field to picograms. These values will correspond to the order you put your ladder in and are the values in Table 2. Double check all inputs once you complete all your standard wells then you are ready to view your results.\n\n\n\nHighlight all cells then move to the “Graphical Displays” to inspect your amplification plots and where your samples fall on your standard curve. You can do a visual inspection here to ensure your samples fall within your standards, but you need to export your Cq values to determine actually concentrations of your samples.\n\n\n\nTo export your Cq values make sure all samples are highlighted in the right hand column. Right click and select “export to excel”. Save your excel file to a hard drive and take it to your personal computer.",

It can be used to find files and directories and perform subsequent operations on them. It supports searching by file, folder, name, creation date, modification date, owner and permissions. By using the - exec other UNIX commands can be executed on files or folders found. (from https://shapeshed.com/unix-find/)\n\nAdditional Information\n\nExtended Tutorial\nfind manual\n\n\nSimple Find\nfind ./directory/path/ -name FileExample.txt\nThis will with find file ./directory/path/FileExample.txt\nRemove files created before a certain date with find\nfind /home/br.ford/br.ford_remote/slim/results/ -ctime +14 -print -exec rm {} \\;\nThis finds all files in the .../results/ directory that are older than 14 days and removes them\nYou can also be more specific. For example, if you want to remove only txt files older than two days:\nfind /home/br.ford/br.ford_remote/slim/results/*.txt -ctime +2 -print -exec mv {} finished_results \\;\n\n\n\nList just subdirectories in the current directory\nls -d */\n\n\n\nsed -i '' 's/[\"]//g' test.txt\nThe -i argument says to use in-place editing (edit and return file without making another copy), the empty quotes identifies extension of backup file (none, unless you want a backup file), the statement in the quotes specifies: to substitute (s/) quotations ([“]) with nothing (//) globally (g’) in test.txt\n\n\n\nWant to change permissions to a directory and all subdirectories, but are not sure which chmod arguments to use to do so recursively?\nUse mac GUI: \n\n\n\nwc -l myfile.txt\n\n\n\nawk 'FNR == 11 {print FILENAME, $0}' NAMEOFFILE.txt\n\nFNR : Line number you want to print\nprint FILENAME : built in awk variable that prints the file name (not needed but nice if you are printing lines from multiple files into a single log file).\n$0 : Tells awk to print the whole line.\nNAMEOFFILE.txt : The specific file you want to print\n\nExample\nPrint out the 11th line from a file.\nCommand\ndowney-wall.a@comp5[20190719_fastqc_trim_10bp_Cvirginica_MBD]# awk 'FNR == 11 {print FILENAME $0}' 17005*R1*.txt \nOutput\n17005_DNAm_R1.fastq.gz_trimming_report.txtAdapter sequence: 'CTGTCTCTTATA' (Nextera Transposase sequence; auto-detected)\nCode Extensions\nMultiple single lines with OR (|| operation)\nawk 'FNR==5 || FNR==9 {$0}' NAMEOFFILE.txt\nA range of lines with AND (&& operation)\nawk 'FNR &gt;= 5 && FNR &lt;= 10 {$0}' NAMEOFFILE.txt\nPrint from multiple files\nawk 'FNR==11 {$0}' *.txt\nSkipping lines\nawk 'NR % 2 {print} !(NR % 2) && /pattern/ {print}' FILENAME.txt\nCounting the columns\nawk -F'\\t' '{print NF; exit}' myfile.txt\n-F’\\t’ tells awk that your columns are tab delimited, you can switch this for another character depending on your dataset. For example, if the data is comma separated just use -F’,’ instead. To print the column count for every line instead of just the first one, leave out ‘exit’.\n\n\nWant to rename lots of files at once?\nSay you have a directory with the following images:\npic1.png\npic2.png\npic3.png\n…\npic27.png\nYou decide that they should have a more descriptive name, so you want to change them to ‘oyster_pic1.png’, ‘oyster_pic2.png’, ‘oyster_pic3.png’….\nYou don’t have to move them individually, just use the bash command ‘rename’ with a regular expression!\n$ rename 's/pic/oyster_pic/g' *\n\n‘s’ at the begining tells the command to substitute a string with another string\n/pic/ is the string you want to replace\n/oyster_pic/ is the string to replace it with\n‘g’ is the global flag – this means replace every instance of the 1st string with the 2nd. Ex, pic1pic.png would become oyster1oyster.png. This may or may not be desirable depending on what you want to do.\n* after the regex just tells rename what to rename - in this case everything in the directory\n\nThe rename command uses perl regular expressions - you can do a lot with these, google perl regex if you want to learn more.\nOn MacOS you may have to install rename before you can do this: $ brew install rename",

It supports searching by file, folder, name, creation date, modification date, owner and permissions. By using the - exec other UNIX commands can be executed on files or folders found.

    "section": "Restriction Digest",
    "text": "Restriction Digest\nFrom NEB website: There are several key factors to consider when setting up a restriction endonuclease digestion. Using the proper amounts of DNA, enzyme and buffer components in the correct reaction volume will allow you to achieve optimal digestion. By definition, 1 unit of restriction enzyme will completely digest 1 ug of substrate DNA in a 50 ul reaction in 60 minutes. This enzyme : DNA : reaction volume ratio can be used as a guide when designing reactions. However, most researchers follow the “typical” reaction conditions listed, where a 5:10 fold overdigestion is recommended to overcome variability in DNA source, quantity and purity. NEB offers the following tips to help you to achieve maximal success in your restriction endonuclease reactions. NEB recommends 10 units restriction enzyme, 1\u0016g DNA, 1X NEB Bu\u000ber (5\u0016L), and 1 hour incubation time. DNA (measured with the Qubit) should ideally be at a minimum total amoung of 1.5 \u0016g and no more than 2.5 \u0016g. For example, you could use 10\u0016L of 150-250 ng/\u0016L of DNA. Keep on ice. Note that your DNA needs to be concentrated at least 125 ng/\u0016L for this protocol (2,500 ng desired/125ng/\u0016L = 20\u0016L + may need 5-7uL master mix depending on enzymes). For each sample prepare a master mix I (Table 1), mix by vortexing and then centrifuge. For these and all other reactions make sure to prepare an excess of mix to accommodate multiple rounds of pipetting, particularly if you are working with whole plates. Because the enzymes are stored in glycerol and other viscous solutions, a substantial volume is lost through adhesion to the outside of pipette tips. We suggest making more than what you think you will need (this may be overkill, if you have fewer columns than just do one extra per column).\n\n\n\nReagent\nNumber of samples 1X (uL)\n\n\n\n\n20 units of Enzyme 1\n(Calc)\n\n\n20 units of Enzyme 2\n(Calc)\n\n\n(10x Concentrate Enzyme Buffer)\n3uL\n\n\nGenomic DNA (1.5-2.5 ug)\n(Calc)\n\n\nMolecular grade H20 to make a final volume of 30 uL\n(Calc)\n\n\n\nNote: The original protocol listed 10xT4 Bu\u000ber instead of the 10X Concentrate Enzyme Bu\u000ber. We think this may have been a typo. 10xT4 Bu\u000ber is designed to work with the Ligase (we use Ligase in the following section) and the 10x Concentrate Enzyme Bu\u000ber is designed to optimize the enzyme. See NEB website. 1. Incubate samples at 37C overnight. NOTE THAT MspI CANNOT BE KILLED BY HEAT. SUGGEST PROCEEDING IMMEDIATELY TO BEAD WASH. 2. After incubation, let reaction cool to room temperature during this time also remove the AMPURE XP beads from the fridge and let them warm to room temperature 3. Add 45 uL of AMPURE XP to each reaction, mix with pipetting 10 times, and then let incubate for 5 mins on the bench 4. Place plate onto the magnet plate and let the beads separate for 5 mins 5. Carefully remove the supernatant from each well and discard 6. Note that you will not be able to remove all of the supernatant without disturbing the beads. It’s best to leave about 5 uL remaining in each well 7. Leaving the plate in the magnet, wash the reaction by adding 200 uL of FRESH 70% ethanol 70% ethanol should be mixed that day! 8. Remove and discard ethanol and repeat with a second ethanol wash. (From Gold Lab Protocol: Puritz prefers to use only 150 uL of ethanol for second wash. Hollenbeck prefers to use only 1 wash step) 9. After \fnal wash, let plates air dry for 5-10 mins. All ethanol needs to be evaporated, but beads should not be overdried. 10. Remove plate from magnet and add 30 uL of molecular grade H2O to each well and incubate for 5 mins. Make sure that water comes into contact with beads by mixing well with pipet 11. Place plate back on magnet and let it separate for 2 minutes, then remove supernatant and transfer to clean plate 12. If doing a second set of digestion, repeat steps 4-11."

    "text": "Pooling and Beadwash\nSet up your pools for size selection on the Pippin Prep. You should have experience using the Pippin before you perform this step. 1. After ligation, it is safe to pool samples within one index. Collect all 30 uL from each well and place it into a single 1.5 mL tube (Use a 2.0 mL tube if using 40 uL ligations). If you are using 16 barcodes within an index, this is 16*30 = 480 uL. 2. Mix each pool with pipetting or gentle vortexing. If it is a large volume split each into equal aliquots according to the number of replicate size selections. (These replicates will be combined in last step. It doesn’t a\u000bect the total amount of beads used, and you can choose to do fewer if you don’t have a lot of product). 3. Add 1.5X uL of AMPURE XP to each aliquot, mix with pipetting 10 times, and then let incubate for 5 mins on the bench. For instance, if you did two replicate size selections of a pool with 16 barcodes, each one would be 480ul/4 = 120 uL of template and 180 uL of beads. 4. Place tube onto the magnet bar and let the beads separate for 5 mins 5. Carefully remove the supernatant from each tube and discard 6. Sometimes pulling tube upwards and tilting bottom towards the magnet allows for complete supernatant removal. If not, leave a few uL. 7. Leaving the tubes in the magnet, wash the reaction by adding 500 uL of FRESH 70% ethanol 70% ethanol should be mixed that day!. Volume is approximate but should cover all beads 8. Remove ethanol, let tubes air dry for 2 mins. All excess ethanol needs to be evaporated, but shiny beads are OK and beads should not be overdried. Pippin is sensitive to EtOH so err on side of more dry. 9. IF DOING REPLICATES: Remove tubes from magnet and add 30 uL of molecular grade H2O to each tube and incubate for 5 mins. Make sure that water comes into contact with beads by mixing well with pipet or gentle vortexing. 10. IF NOT DOING REPLICATES: Remove tubes from magnet and add 30 uL of TE to each tube and incubate for 5 mins. Make sure that water comes into contact with beads by mixing well with pipet or gentle vortexing. (We use TE here because it helps the DNA stay in the well of the Pippin Prep). 11. Place tubes back on magnet and let beads separate for 2 minutes, then remove supernatant and transfer to a clean 1.5 mL tube. If you used replicates, pool within each index. This means going from multiple aliquots to one tube for each index. 12. IF YOU USED REPLICATES, DO THE FOLLOWING STEPS TO POOL. IF NOT, YOU ARE DONE. If you used replicates, add 1.5X uL of AMPURE XP to each tube, mix with pipetting 10 times, and then let incubate for 5 mins on the bench. 13. Place tubes onto the magnet bar and let the beads separate for 5 mins 14. Carefully remove the supernatant from each tube and discard. Sometimes pulling tube upwards and tilting bottom towards the magnet allows for complete supernatant removal. If not, leave a few uL. 15.

Remove tubes from magnet and add 20 uL of TE to each tube and incubate for 5 mins A. Make sure that water comes into contact with beads by mixing well with pipet or gentle vortexing. We use TE here because it helps the DNA stay in the well for the pippin. 19. Place tubes back on magnet and let beads separate for 2 minutes, then remove supernatant and transfer to a clean 1.5 mL tube.\nSAFE STOP POINT. Store at 4C for a month, or -20C for longer. It is important to save this, as all of this product is not used for the PCR, and if the results of the PCR do not look good, you can start again from this step."

    "section": "Size selection (approx. 2 hours)",
    "text": "Size selection (approx. 2 hours)\nWe use a Pippin Prep to do size selection. Pippin works in a similar way to typical gel electrophoresis, but uses standardized gel cassettes and automated size selection, rather than a hand-poured gel and manual excision of fragments from a gel. It is necessary to specify a size range of fragments that you would like represented in the \fnal genomic library for sequencing. The target size range can be adjusted to modify the number of fragments expected for sequencing. Because techniques such as this typically result in a negative relationship between fragment size and number, selecting larger fragments should decrease the \fnal number of fragments in the template and increase the coverage depth of these regions after sequencing. Similarly, decreasing the size interval selected will also reduce the number of fragments and increase coverage. The number of fragments produced is also in part a function of genome size, so awareness of your organisms genome size is helpful in making an appropriate choice for size selection (see Fig. 3 of Alexs protocol, and Figure 1 in SCHWEYEN 2014). We have typically used a 100-150 bp range somewhere between 250 and 500 bp in total fragment length (meaning that we might select, as an example, fragments that are 300 - 400 bp in length). Dr Lotterhos has an R script that can be used to do an in silico digest of a genome. It is called ddRADoysterdigestion.R (for C. gigas oyster) but can be applied to any genome. The basic code is in a post on her blog. You should calculate your size range based on the the number of fragments in your selected size range, and your plan for sequencing (the number of paired-end reads and their read length and the total number of bases captured)."

See autoclave training information if this is your first lab work at the MSC!\nWhen using plates, it can be more difficult to keep track of which samples go in which wells, since you can not label wells directly. It is advised to draw the layout of the plate and plan sample allocation on to the wells ahead of time, and keep that layout near by for reference during tissue digestion prep. Also, make sure to keep plates in the same orientation (top left corner A-1) at all times.\n\n\n\n\n\nReserve plate centrifuge in Hughes lab if using plates.\nMake sure kit purification buffers are diluted as directed in the kit manual.\n\n\n\n\nD1-1.

Sterilize surfaces and area around the scale - wipe with with 10 % bleach first, then DI H2O, then 70-90% EtOH.\nD1-3. Remove tissue samples from freezer and let thaw (do not let them sit any longer than necessary). Take ~10 samples at the time. Once thawed they can be placed on ice/cold beads.\nD1-4. Pre-load lysis plate or sterile eppendorf tubes with 200 uL of TL buffer per well plate or tube using a serile pipette tip.\nD1-5. Tare scale with a piece of weighing paper on it.\nD1-6. Dip ONLY the cutting edge of the blade into EtOH in beaker. Move the beaker aside. Hold the blade vertically, away from your body and away from the EtOH beaker and flame the blade. When all EtOH has burned off and the flame is gone, set the sterile blade on a clean kimwipe on the bench. Dip the tip of the forceps into EtOH beaker, move the beaker aside. Hold the forceps horizontally, away from your body and from the EtOH beaker and flame the forceps to sterilize.\nD1-7. Using the sterile forceps, carefully remove tissue from 2mL tube and set it on the kimwipe. Using the sterile razor blade, cut a piece of tissue 15-20 mg. Pat dry the piece of tissue with a clean kimwipe, so that the tissue appears nearly dry.\nD1-8. Place tissue on weigh paper and record the weight in lab notebook. If the tissue weights less than 15mg or more than 20mg, remove or add more tissue as needed to reach this range.\nD1-9. Take the weigh paper out of the scale, set it on a clean kimwipe and use the sterile forceps and blade to cut up the tissue into smaller pieces.\nD1-10. Transfer the cut up tissue to a well plate or an eppendorf tube, making sure that all pieces of tissue fall into the buffer.\nD1-11. Label the tube with sample ID, or keep track of the plate layout on your lab notebook, so you know which samples are in which wells.\nD1-12. Discard the used blade into the sharps container. Discard all used kimwipes and wipe the bench again with 70-90% EtOH.\n\nNote: Between samples, a new blade should be used if available and forceps should be sterilized by diping in EtOH and flaming to burn off any residual EtOH and tissue.\n\nD1-13. Repeat steps 5-12 until all samples are in buffer.\nD-14. Add 25uL of OB Protease Solution (OB Protease and Proteinase K, provided with the kit, serve the same purpose as digestive buffers) to each sample tube or well plate. You can reuse the tip if you are sure that the tip did not touch the liquid or the sides of the tubes or wells. If the tip does touch any surfaces in the lysis plate or tubes, replace with a sterile tip.\nD-15. Close tubes or seal plate with a silicone mat, confirm all tubes or plate wells are labelled correctly and vortex the tubes/plate for 15 seconds.\nD-16. Place samples on thermomixer. Before restarting the mixer: Make sure all tube caps are securely fastened/plate is securely sealed. In addition, after 2 minutes on the thermomixer confirm the tube caps/silicone mat have not popped open.\nNote: Samples can be left for at least 3 hours or overnight to allow for all tissue to be completely lysed. If possible, pause the mixer, take plate/tubes out and vortex them for 15 sec every 1/2h to 1h to help with lysis.\n\n\n\nD2-1. Sterilize bench top - wipe with with 10% bleach first, then DI H2O, then 70-90% EtOH.\nD2-2. Heat up heating block (or check oven temperature in Hughes lab) to 70oC and place the volume needed of elution buffer (or molecular grade water) in it.\nD2-3. Follow the kit manual for plates or individual tubes for DNA purification with the following modifications, if needed:\n\nSkip the optional step “add RNAase”\nSkip the optional step “column equilibration”\nWhen centrifuging the lysis plate and the E-Z 96 DNA plate (mini-columns plate), tape them together.\nSkip the optional step “dry samples at 70oC”\nWe prefer to use molecular grade water as the elution buffer instead of the kit buffer.\nElution volume may vary depending on starting material and extraction yield. Minimum volume is 30 uL, to ensure that the entire memembrane is soaked with elution buffer.\nThe second elution can be eluted into a separate tube, if there are concerns about DNA concentration in the first elution.\nAlign the tubes in the centrifuge in this manner:\n\nTube alignment\nD2-4. You will likely need to spot-check the concentration of your extracted DNA, either by Qubit or Picogreen assay. Both are destructive assays, meaning you will need to use some aliquote (typically 1-2 uL) of your eluted DNA to measure concentration. Make note of how much you used from which samples, to keep track of how much is available for downstream library prep and sequencing.\nD2-5. Extracted DNA can be place in fridge for a few days, or store at -20oC or -80oC for long term storage. Avoid numerous freeze-thaw cycles.",

Heat up heating block (or check oven temperature in Hughes lab) to 70oC and place the volume needed of elution buffer (or molecular grade water) in it.\nD2-3. Follow the kit manual for plates or individual tubes for DNA purification with the following modifications, if needed:\n\nSkip the optional step “add RNAase”\nSkip the optional step “column equilibration”\nWhen centrifuging the lysis plate and the E-Z 96 DNA plate (mini-columns plate), tape them together.\nSkip the optional step “dry samples at 70oC”\nWe prefer to use molecular grade water as the elution buffer instead of the kit buffer.\nElution volume may vary depending on starting material and extraction yield. Minimum volume is 30 uL, to ensure that the entire memembrane is soaked with elution buffer.\nThe second elution can be eluted into a separate tube, if there are concerns about DNA concentration in the first elution.\nAlign the tubes in the centrifuge in this manner:\n\nTube alignment\nD2-4. You will likely need to spot-check the concentration of your extracted DNA, either by Qubit or Picogreen assay. Both are destructive assays, meaning you will need to use some aliquote (typically 1-2 uL) of your eluted DNA to measure concentration. Make note of how much you used from which samples, to keep track of how much is available for downstream library prep and sequencing.\nD2-5. Extracted DNA can be place in fridge for a few days, or store at -20oC or -80oC for long term storage. Avoid numerous freeze-thaw cycles.",

    "text": "This tutorial provides basic guidance for taking high-quality images, identifying polydora worm blisters, and using ImageJ to calculate total area of blister infection.\n\n\n\n\nDSLR camera or digital camera. An phone camera may work if it focuses on very close objects.\nCamera stand or tripod that allows the camera lens to point directly down\nLevel table in a room with consistent, bright, indoor lighting. No natural light is ideal.\n3-4 black beanbags, ideally with sand or small particles\nColor scale swatch card with grey scale\nAn object of known invariable length (we use the length of a square in our color scale swatch card)\nA computer to run the freely-available ImageJ software\nA spreadsheet or app to collect data in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelpful but not required materials\n\n\n\n\nA tablet or computer with touch screen and a stylus\nComputer mouse (instead of laptop trackpad)\nLarge external hard drive to store image backups\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step in the protocol is to take high-quality images of each shell. We photograph both valves together in one image. We also include a label with the ID number of the individual in the image for easy reference and a color scale card to ensure the color balance is consistent across images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScale + Level\n\n\n\nIt’s crucial that all images of your study organism are taken at the same scale and are level. Any differences in the height of the object to the camera will translate into measurement differences in ImageJ. For this reason, use a level surface and do not vary the height of the tripod and camera. Keep all objects in the frame consistent in their distance to the camera lens across all images.\nTips: If possible, do not move the tripod setup until all imaging is complete. If needed, use a prop (e.g. beanbags) to support each object on a level plane. Do not change the height of the supportive materials - for example, do not vary the number of beanbags stacked under each object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttach camera to tripod setup. Focus the camera and take a trial image to test lighting.\nRemove the oyster shells and ID tag from the bag. Ensure the ID tag matches the label on the bag. Clear any dust or particles off of the inner shells.\nStabilize the shells on top of black beanbags to ensure they sit parallel to the table and about ~5-6 inches below the camera lens.\nFocus the camera and take a few images with both shells, ID tag, and the color swatch in the frame. Make small adjustments in between images if necessary to ensure there is no glare on the shells.\n\n\n\n\nExample image showing both valves, ID tag, and color scale card\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpload the images from the camera into a folder on the computer that will use the ImageJ software. Label the folder based on the ID_Site_Date population info. Name each of the images a unique name. We use SG_XXXX_PD to stand for seascape genomics, individual ID number, and Polydora.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollecting Data\n\n\n\nWe collected our data using an app designed with AppSheet and linked to two Google Sheets - one for whole oyster shell measurements, and one for individual blister measurements. From this point on, if you are not using an app, record your data in whichever spreadsheet(s) you are collecting measurements in, we will refer to “app” as the data collection location.\n\n\n\nUpload the full color image of each individual into the app under the Image_valves_full_color field.\nInput TRUE or FALSE for Infection_status based on the individual. If there is at least one blister, the infection status is TRUE.\nUpload the full color image to ImageJ twice.\nConvert one of the images to 8-bit grey scale by selecting Image-&gt;Type-&gt;8-bit in ImageJ for color comparison.\nSet the measurement scale in ImageJ by using the linear selection tool to draw a diagonal line across a square on the color swatch. This is our scale object of known invariable length. Select Analyze -&gt; Set scale and add the length of the diagonal line in the Known Distance text box and the unit in the Unit of Length text box.\n\n\n\n\nThe linear selection tool is used to calculate our known distance\n\n\n\nMeasure the area of each shell. Use the free draw selection tool to select the entire area of each value with the stylus, then press “m” on your keyboard to get the area. Enter the data from the pop up measurement window into the app.\n\n\n\n\nThe free draw selection tool is used to map the entire area of each valve\n\n\n\nLeave the Blister_count, Total_area_infected, and Total_area_infected_current_blisters_only fields blank (for now), save the data, and open the blister data field in the app.\nFill in the polydora_blistersLabel field with SG_XXXX_PD_n, with n being the count of the blister that you are processing.\nMeasure the area of the blister. Use the free draw selection tool to draw around the perimeter of the blister then press “m” on your keyboard to get the area. Enter the area into the app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverlapping Blisters\n\n\n\nAbiotic or biotic environmental stress on oysters may reduce the ability of the oyster to secrete new layers of shell to recover from infestation. It has been hypothesized in the literature that as oysters secrete new layers of shell over blisters, the color of the blister becomes lighter Dorgan et al 2021. Due to this hypothesized dynamic, we have a specific protocol for collecting data from overlapping blisters.\nIf a white blister and a yellow blister are overlapping, record the area of the entire yellow blister, and crop the area of the white blister to record only the part that does not have overlapping blisters. We collect data this way in order to (1) avoid collecting the same blistered area twice, and (2) accurately estimate the extent of recent/current infections. Assuming that opaque white blisters indicate shell repair over fully healed blisters, yellowed and dark spots are current blisters that are not yet covered with shell repair.\n This image shows the correct way to collect area data from overlapping blisters. The yellow blister area is calculated in its entirety, the white area is cropped, and we avoid collecting the area of overlapping blisters twice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMulticolored Blisters\n\n\n\nIn the case of a large, complex blister that has multiple colors, it would take a lot of time to collect data on each small section of it. Instead, view the image in 8-bit grey scale. If they are the same hex code designation in the 8-bit photo, you can count it as one large blister.\n This image shows how a complex large blister with multiple colors (yellow, black, brown) is the same shade in grey scale. We count this blister as one occurrence and collect area and hex code data accordingly.\n\n\n\nUsing the 8-bit photo, record which hex code and number (1-6) is closest to the blister color in Blister_hex_code app field. We determine best hex code match by eye, with the grey scale hex color palette open on the computer screen next to the 8-bit image.\nRecord Blister_location based on the position in the shell (hinge, center, edge). Record the Blister_valve which specifies if the blister was on the left or right valve in the image.\nAfter completing steps 13-16 for all of the blisters on both shells, go back into the main spreadsheet (related polydoras) to update the Blister_count with the count of total count of blisters processed across both valves.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo calculate the Total_area_infected, reference the polydora_blisters tab on the SeascapeSamples spreadsheet. Copy all of the data from the individual just processed and paste into a running excel sheet. Reference the polydora tab on the SeascapeSamples spreadsheet and copy the individuals data into the excel sheet. Highlight all of the blister area values for the individual and record the sum value. Divide the sum value by the total area of the individual (both valves added together). Add this value to the app under Total_area_infected.\nTo calculate the Total_area_infected_current_blisters_only, highlight all of the blisters except the 1-FFFFFF colored blisters and record the sum value. Divide the sum value by the total area of the individual (both valves added together). Add this value to the app under Total_area_infected_current_blisters_only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpreadsheet Format for Data Analysis\n\n\n\nIn this running excel sheet setup, the NEXT line indicates the start point for data from a new individual. The data from each blister is listed in rows. Below the data, WSUM equals the sum without white blisters (removing any 1-FFFFFF hex code areas). To the right of the data, P1/P2 stands for percentage 1, the percent area of all blisters on the shell, and percentage 2, the percent area of only current blisters on the shell.\n\n\n\nExample excel spreadsheet format for calculating total area infected\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptionally, you can use features in ImageJ to prepare publication-quality images. We used the freehand selection tool to select each oyster valve, and then removed everything in the background with Edit -&gt; Clear Outside.\nThen, we transferred images to powerpoint and used freehand markup tools to create publication-quality composite images like this one!\n\n\n\nComposite image and hex code scale",

    "text": "Edit this page\n\nWorkflow parallelization approaches:\na. One the shared resources, limits on each partition are determined according to the following table: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/hardware/partitions.html#introduction. If your jobs have exceeded those limits, this may have been the cause of job terminations.\nb. On the “lotterhos” partition, you do not have any restrictions on number of submitted jobs, or requested cpus. To submit to the lotterhos partition, simply set the SLURM flag for this partition:\nFor an interactive job (example): srun -p lotterhos --nodes=1 --cpus-per-task=1 --pty --time=24:00:00 /bin/bash\nThis example will allocate a single node with 1 CPU (and –ntasks=1 by default, but alternatively, you can also use this instead:\nsrun -p lotterhos --nodes=1 --ntasks =1 --pty --time=24:00:00 /bin/bash for 24 hours, and flag --pty will set all output to be printed to the screen. /bin/bash is the command to be run for this job, so any bash command after this will be executed.\nIf you run this command, you can type: lscpu to get the hardware info (such as core count).\nFor a batch (background) job, adding the following to your bash script is equivalent:\n#SBATCH -p lotterhos\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --time=24:00:00\nIf your shell script looks the same, and the only thing changing is a particular parameter, for example:\n#SBATCH -p lotterhos\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --time=24:00:00\nprogram input-X output-X\nThen you can also take advantage of the job-array structure to submit multiple jobs at a time. Each SLURM job that is defined as array will have several bash variables associated with this that are defined once the job is submitted. The main important variable that can be useful is: $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID For example, if you create a SLURM array job with 10 jobs in the array, then the values $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID will get are: 1,…,10 (each job in the array will be assigned with a number 1-10, and can be distinguished this way). Here, %10 means all 10 jobs are set to run together. Setting %1 means they will run one after another.\n#SBATCH -p lotterhos\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --time=24:00:00\n#SBATCH --array=1-10:%10\nprogram input-$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID output-$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID\nThis setup will run the program on a specific input file based on the $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID  value (input-1,input-2,…,input-10) and will output the results to output file named based on the value of $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID  (output-1,output-2,…,output-10).\nThere is a hard limit of an array size of 1000 that research computing cannot increase.\nIn addition, this kind of code will not work: #SBATCH —array=1001-1951%68 because the array index goes over 1000 (Even though the number of jobs in the array is less than 1000). So if you have more than 1000 simulations, I don’t recommend the array approach.\n\n\nc. Parallelizing your R script: You can also leverage the entire 36 cores on each on the lotterhos nodes in a single job by using a threading parallelization scheme. Specifically, you can use the parallel processing R libraries such as “foreach” to increase the efficiency of your loops. You can then parallelize specific chunks of your code (mainly, loops) by importing the parallel libraries. For example, if your r code is this:\n#import packages\nlibrary(foreach)\nlibrary(doParallel)\n#number of iterations\niters&lt;-1e4\n#setup parallel backend to use 8 processors\ncl&lt;-makeCluster(36)\nregisterDoParallel(cl)\n#start time\nstrt&lt;-Sys.time()\n#loop\nls&lt;-foreach(icount(iters)) %dopar% {\n    to.ls&lt;-rnorm(1e6)\n    to.ls&lt;-summary(to.ls)\n    to.ls\n    }\nprint(Sys.time()-strt)\nstopCluster(cl)\nSource\nThen, you can set up an array job that looks like this:\n#SBATCH -p lotterhos\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=36\n#SBATCH --time=24:00:00\n#SBATCH --array=1-10:%10\nr-parallel-program  input-$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID  output-$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID",

    "text": "Determining Barcodes and Indexes for Illumina Sequencing\nEdit this page\nTips for determining barcodes and indexes for Illumina Sequencing.\n\nFirst, you should make a plan for the adapters that you are going to use for each sample. As you choose adapters, you want to ensure that there is not low diversity in the indexes or in the first 5-6 bases of every read. Low diversity can result in high error rates because of an unbalanced color scheme as explained here by Illumina:\nIllumina Low Plex Pooling Guidelines\nThe term “nucleotide diversity” describes the proportion of each nucleotide (A, T, C, and G) at each position in a sequencing library. A “balanced” or “diverse” library has equal proportions of A, C, G, and T nucleotides at each base position in a sequencing library. In particular, nucleotide diversity is key during the first 4–7 cycles of Read 1 for all Illumina sequencing systems. The sequencing software uses images from these early cycles to identify the location of each cluster in a process called template generation. This results in overclustering. Overclustering creates image analysis problems, including loss of focus, poor template generation, and issues with cluster registration. The increased overall signal brightness of the flow cell makes it difficult for the sequencer to read and find the appropriate focal plane.\nIllumina Consequences of Overclustering\nNext, and especially if you are doing library prep for the first time, I suggest that you draw out what is happening to the DNA or RNA at every step of the process:\nExample Genomic Library Prep with p5 inline barcode and index in p7 PCR Primer\nExample Library prep with inline barcodes and dual indexes\nFor genomic DNA library prep, we are now working with inline barcodes on the P5 (left) adapter and indexes on the P7 (right) adapter. See above figure for details (note: KEL thinks there is issues with this system and this may change). These can give up to 12*12 = 144 unique barcodes. But, keep in mind that every sample can’t have the same barcode (e.g., can’t have 12 samples with 1 barcode and 12 indexes), and every sample can’t have the same index (e.g., can’t have 12 samples with 12 barcodes and 1 index) because of the low-diversity problem.\nAlso, note that the indexes will also demultiplex with Illumina’s software at the sequencing facility. But after you receive them, the reads will need to be further demultiplexed using the inline barcodes with a program such as STACKS.\nLotterhos adapter and primer database\nLotterhos y-adapters with inline barcodes and dual indexes",

    "text": "Edit this page\nProtocols for understanding different types of ethanol and when to use them.\n\nNote: this protocols page may be outdated.\n\n\nThe main difference is that denatured ethanol contains additives that make it unsafe to drink. On the other hand, non-denatured ethanol is ethanol with no additives or denaturants.\nDenatured ethanol is a form of ethanol containing a high amount of additives and denaturants that makes it poisonous. Denatured ethanol has bad taste and foul smell that makes it unsafe for drinking. There are two forms of non-denatured ethanol named 95% ethanol and absolute ethanol. These forms are known as “pure” forms of ethanol.\n\n\n\nHistological/reagent ethanol is denatured ethanol. Molecular grade ethanol is non-denatured. Source\n\n\n\nThis article has the following information on ethanol for tissue preservation:\n\nIf possible, the use of non-denaturated ethanol is favoured, but traces of denaturating agents (e.g. isopropanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, also gasoline) usually do not significantly alter the performance.\nAccording to plenty of tests, the optimal concentration is about 95–99% (King and Porter 2004, who also compared with isopropanol).\nWith 70% ethanol, a high degree of degradation has been observed, even after one year.\nInterestingly, absolute ethanol may not be the optimal medium as it is most expensive and can contain traces of benzene that seriously affect DNA preservation (Ito 1992).\n\nSide note: KEL tried to find Ito 1992, but the orginal print is not available online.\n\nThe ethanol-tissue ratio should exceed 5:1, although some authors recommend much higher ratios (e.g. Martin 1977).\nWhen ordering, look for “pure ethanol” and check the SDS to make sure it does not contain additives\n95.6% ethanol is an azeotrope, which means the vapor state has the same ethanol-to-water ratio as the liquid state. This means as it evaporates the remaining liquid will still be at 95.6%\nWhen adding wet tissues to 95% ethanol, it can decrease the concentration of ethanol. It can be helpful to change the ethanol after the first few months.\nMore information on other ways to preserve tissues are found in this article\n\nORDERING INFORMATION:Ethyl alcohol, Pure 190 proof, meets USP testing specifications, non-denatured ethanol 493538-4L\nEthanol, 190 proof, 95%, Reagent ACS, Spectrophotometric Grade, Thermo Scientific Chemicals AC615110040\nUSP vs. ACS ethanol: ACS reagent grade ethyl alcohol meets or exceeds the specifications the American Chemical Society’s Reagent Handbook. USP Grade are chemicals manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and which meet the requirements of the US Pharmacopeia. ACS and USP are generally equivalent.\n\n\n\nInformation from this article explains the use of ethanol for cleaning. The main points are summarized here:\n\nAlthough it may seem counter-intuitive, 70% ethanol seems to be the most effective concentration, as 90% ethanol coagulates the protein, and the protein layer that is created effectively renders the cell dormant. At a 70% concentration, however, the ethanol takes longer to evaporate and this longer contact time means that it is able to penetrate cells more effectively. The water in a 70% grade is also important in denaturing proteins. And 70% ethanol also tends to be cheaper and is less flammable.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, diluted ethanol is no longer an azeotrope. At 70%, ethanol will evaporate faster than water, so evaporative loss will result in a gradual decrease in ethanol concentration in the remaining solution. Don’t be surprised when an unsealed beaker of 70% ethanol ‘stops working’. So don’t make more than is necessary at a time, and make sure to label the date when it was made (which you should do for everything you make anyway).\nSecond, ethanol/water mixtures don’t have additive volumes. That means that if you want to make 1 liter of 70% ethanol from absolute ethanol, you can’t do it by mixing 700 ml of ethanol and 300 ml of water. The correct method is to measure 700 ml of ethanol and then bring it to a volume of 1 liter with water.\n\nWhy? When you mix water and ethanol, the ethanol molecules occupy the space between the water molecules. A helpful way to visualize this is to think about sand and rocks – if you were to mix 1 liter of each, the final volume would be less than 2 liters because the sand would fall between the rocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething about the process of making ethanol makes it hard to get from 95% to 100%. Sometimes this contains additives to get it up to 100%, but they are not denaturing agents.\nSome procedures that are sensitive to the presence of water require absolute ethanol.\nA common method to produce ethanol with a higher concentration than 95% is to use additives that disrupt the azeotrope composition and allow further distillation. For this reason, absolute ethanol sometimes contains trace amounts of these additives (such as benzene). source\n\nORDERING INFORMATION Ethyl alcohol, Pure 200 proof, for molecular biology E7023-4L",

    "text": "General Directory Organization\nEdit this page\nThe protocol for maintaining consistency when creating directories\n\nFor each new project you’ll want to have a dedicated folder to contain all major data files and code script related to that project. Even if you are re-using scripts that are already located in another project’s folder, consider copying that code over into your new projects’ folder, instead of reading it from another location.\nThe guiding principle should be that you want to be able to run your whole project’s code (barring any software you have to download) using the scripts that are located within that projects’ folder. That way, if you ever have to move your project files to another computer, you won’t be missing any scripts on which you’re dependent.\nSo once you’ve made a new project folder, for example by using the mkdir command in the terminal\n&gt; mkdir NewProject\nyou’ll want to navigate into that folder (cd NewProject) and create subdirectories to house specific file types.\nTwo good startig folders to have are a src folder and a results folder. An src folder (derived from “source”), should house all the core scripts necessary for your project. So all novel R scripts, Python code, Perl pipelines you’ve dredged up, etc. would be housed here. The results folder would house all output files generated by scripts in src.\nDepending on the project, you’ll want to have a data folder to keep the raw data sets that you yourself did not generate with the scripts in src.\nFinally, you’ll want to create a simple text README file that explicitly states what subdirectories you have in your project folder, and what they should contain. Ideally you should have a README file in each directory that states what files it contains.\nA README file written in markdown could look like this:\n# Files for New Project by Student McGee and PI ForFree, Year Month(s)\n\nShort description of New Project\n\n## Description of each folder or file and the data contained within:\n  src - What scripts are here?\n  results - What kind of result files are here?\n  data - What sort of data?\nOnce you’ve set up your project folder, it should look something like this:\n\nQuick notes: simfiles folder results folder src folder",

Hazardous chemicals are noted in this protocol as well when they are called for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWear gloves for all steps in this process. Do not touch door handles or computers with gloves on (unless the keyboard says “gloves only”).\n\n\n\nSample transfer: Samples will be in multiple boxes in freezer, but we only want to take a box out once to minimize sample degradation.\n\nFirst, develop a sample transfer plan which lists which samples in a given box will be going into which places on the tray. Work with Dr. Lotterhos to develop the plan.\nTake one box out of the freezer, transfer samples to appropriate location on the ordered trays.\n\nIf you are reusing S-blocks, ensure that they have been sterilized in an HCl bath and autoclaved prior to use. If they have not been or if you are unsure, follow this protocol. If you are using a kit for the first time, you do not need to sterilize/HCl bath the S-block, as it is already sterile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizing trays according to data plan\n\n\n\nSamples were randomized into different positions on different plates. There is a datasheet for this layout that was used to fill plates with corresponding samples. Pictures of the datasheet and organized samples are shown below.\nData plan for sample organization  Camille could you add a picture from your plate organization spreadsheet here? \nOrdered tray according to sample organization above \n\n\n\nIf any precipitate has formed in either the Buffer ATL or Buffer AL, warm solution(s) to 56 degrees C on the Isotemp or Thermomixer until precipitates have fully dissolved. The Isotemp is in the left corner of the pre-PCR counter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLab member roles during tissue lysis\n\n\n\nThis process goes smoothest with three lab members working at once. Two lab members should cut and weigh tissue samples, and read out or write down weights to the third lab member who will record them in the spreadsheet or app and place samples into corresponding collection tubes. It’s very easy to put tissue into the wrong collection tubes, so having one person committed to placing the samples into tubes is good. That person should also use the plastic sheet to avoid contamination.\n\n\n\nPrep surfaces and area around the scale. First clean with bleach solution, followed by DI H2O, then 70% EtOH.\nGet a styrofoam container with ice to keep tissue samples cool while prepping for extraction. Ice is located to the right of the sink in the gel room.\nRemove one plate of tissue from freezer and briefly thaw on counter (do not let them sit any longer than necessary). Once thawed they can be placed on ice (this generally won’t cause them to re-freeze).\nGet a tissue collection tube rack from Qiagen kit box. The clear tubes are already in a clear blue rack and have a clear lid over them.\nUse the EasyPet to add 18 mL Buffer ATL (note: hazardous if inhaled) to a 25 mL liquid boat (enough for 100 samples). Then add 180uL Buffer ATL to each tissue collection tube using the P300 multichannel pipette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips for pipetting\n\n\n\nSee page on Pipettes and Pipetting Tips for best pipetting practices and troubleshooting.\n\n\n\nFill a 50 mL falcon tube with 70% ethanol. Light the ethanol lamp using the lighter in the drawer in front of the scale. Sterilize your forceps, scalpel, and pokey stick before starting by dipping them in the ethanol and then running them through the lamp to burn the ethanol off. Be careful not to let the ethanol run down the handles of any equipment, or the flame will catch there too and you could burn yourself.\nTare piece of weighing paper on scale.\nCarefully remove tissue from 2mL tube using sterilized forceps. Place the tissue on a weigh boat to cut. Use a sterile scalpel blade to cut a piece of tissue roughly 20mg in weight (cut on weigh boat). Using 95% pure EtoH, gently rinse tissue in weigh boat and pat dry with clean Kim wipe, so that the tissue appears nearly dry.\nPlace tissue on weigh paper and measure the weight. If the tissue weighs 20mg+/-2mg place it in extraction tube, using the plastic sheet over the tube rack to only expose the tube you’re working with. If the tissue is not the correct weight, either remove tissue as necessary or add more from sample tissue. If adding more, make sure to rinse with EtOH and dry the new tissue. Then make sure the tissue is pushed all the way down into the buffer at the bottom of the collection tube.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNote: Make sure tissue is all the way at the bottom of the well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant: Prevent cross-contamination\n\n\n\nBetween samples, the scalpel & forceps should be sterilized by wiping with a Kimwipe to remove any remaining tissue, dipping in 70% EtoH, and using a flame to burn off any residual EtoH and tissue. Scalpels are very sharp, be very careful when wiping with a Kim wipe, as it’s very easy to cut yourself. Consider placing the Kim wipe on the counter, and wiping the scalpel off on it there. Sterilize plastic sheet between samples by spraying with 70% EtOH and wiping with a Kim wipe. Make sure to carefully clean the hole punch where samples may contact. Remake plastic sheet between plates.\n\n\n\nRecord tissue weight in lab notebook or app by well location, not by vial ID. Place sample into appropriate collection well plate (cyan plates). Keep plate covered with plastic sheet that has a hole in the center. This hole will expose one well at a time for tissue transfer. Sterilize plastic sheet between samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntering sample weights into the app\n\n\n\nOpen the Seascape Samples Extractions app on your laptop or lab iPad (passcode is 0156). Select the plate you are extracting from on the home page, then select the extraction entry for the current extraction. Scroll down to Extraction_mg_tissue and click “Add.” Enter data into all fields as prompted.\n\n\n\nWhen you are nearly finished with tissue cutting, preheat Thermo-mixer to 56°C. Make sure the plate attachment is on and not the tube attachment. If you need to switch attachments, push the blue button down to release the attachment.\nAdd 2 mL Proteinase K to a 25 mL liquid boat (enough for 100 samples). Once all samples have been cut and placed in collection tubes, pipette 20 uL Proteinase K into each sample tube.\nSeal wells with collection microtube caps from Qiagen kit, then place clear rack lid back on the tube rack. Use vortexer with plate attachment (shown below) to mix samples, then centrifuge using Hughes lab centrifuge or the large centrifuge in the shared molecular space for 20-30s at 4500 rpm if using Hughes centrifuge or 4400 rpm if using shared molecular space centrifuge, ensuring that a counter weight is placed into the centrifuge before starting. Add water to counter weight to account for differences in weight if necessary (Use practice extraction plate as counter weight.)\n\nVortexer plate attachment: \n\nPlace entire tube rack with individual tube caps and rack lid on Thermomixer set at 56°C at 600 rpm (we have plate attachment, but plates are too tall, so just put the sample plate on the mixer without the Thermomixer lid fully sealed. Still place the Thermomixer lid on the tube rack, it just won’t close all the way, and that’s okay). BEFORE STARTING THE MIXER: Make sure all tube caps are securely fastened. In addition, after 2 minutes on the thermo-mixer confirm the tube caps haven’t popped open.\nSamples can be left for at least 2 hours or overnight to allow for all tissue to be completely lysed. Samples can be in Thermomixer from the time the tissue prep is finished until you are ready to start the extraction first thing the following morning (usually ~ 2pm to 9am the following day).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Stop Points\n\n\n\nOnce you start the extraction process, there aren’t any good stopping points mid-protocol. Letting the DNA sit out for too long outside of incubation steps could lead to DNA degradation, so it’s important to keep the process moving once you start.\n\n\n\nPrep surfaces and area around the work bench. First clean with bleach solution, followed by DI H2O, then 70% EtoH.\nRemove the entire sample tube rack from the Thermomixer and ensure microtubes in the tube rack are properly sealed with their individual caps. Cover again with clear plastic lid and shake the tube rack vigorously by hand for 15 seconds. Then secure the lid to the rack with lab tape. Centrifuge in the Hughes lab centrifuge (30s at 4500 rpm) or the shared molecular space centrifuge (45s at 4400 rpm) to collect any solution from the caps. Hold down short spin button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuffer AL prep\n\n\n\nNote that buffer AL is a hazardous chemical (causes skin irritation and serious eye irritation). Ensure ethanol has been added to Buffer AL according to instructions on the container. The cap should be marked if ethanol has been added.\n\n\n\nUse 25 mL serological pipette tips with the Easy-Pet pipette to transfer 45 mL Buffer AL to a 50mL liquid boat (enough for a full plate of samples). Carefully remove sample caps and add 410 μl Buffer AL using the 300μL multichannel pipette (split this into two rounds of pipetting 205μl of Buffer AL, only go to the first stop to avoid bubbles). If you are careful not to touch the pipette tip to the sample tubes or another contaminated surface, you can put the same tip into the buffer multiple times to transfer the full volume. Tightly reseal with new caps.\nPlace clear cover over the rack and shake vigorously for 15s by hand. Secure the lid to the rack with lab tape, then centrifuge in the Hughes Lab centrifuge (30s at 4500 rpm) or shared lab space centrifuge (45s at 4400 rpm) to collect any solution from the caps. Make sure to add water to the counterweight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing counterweights\n\n\n\nFor every centrifuge step, you need a counterweight that is equal in weight and height to whatever sample plate you are spinning. We have an extra of almost every plate to use as a counterweight. When you add a new buffer to the sample plate, make sure to add the same volume of tap water to the counterweight to even out the weights. Use the scale to check the weights of the sample plate and counterweight before going over to the Hughes lab. They should be within a few grams of each other and the same height.\n\n\n\nPlace DNeasy 96 plate on the S-Block. Make sure well A1 is directly on top of well A1, etc. Note that the DNeasy plate on the S-block is very prone to tipping, especially when applying tape sheets. Be careful not to let them tip or lysate may slosh out and cause contamination between samples.\nCarefully remove caps from the collection microtubes & transfer all lysate of each sample to the corresponding wells on the DNeasy 96 plate using filtered tips. Our P200 filtered tips only fit on the P100 multichannel, so set the P100 multichannel pipette to 100 uL, and transfer all lysate in as many rounds as necessary to get as much as possible into the DNeasy plate. The lysate can get super bubbly, so be careful not to get any sample up into the actual pipette. There’s usually about 600 uL total lysate in each sample. Pop any bubbles using a pipette tip. Dispose of empty collection microtubes and blue tube rack in the mayo jar.\nSeal the plate with an AirPore tape sheet which comes with the Qiagen kit, then secure the DNeasy plate to the S-block with lab tape. Centrifuge in the Hughes centrifuge (13 min at 4500 rpm).\nRemove tape and carefully add 500μl of Buffer AW1 to each sample. AW1 is harmful if ingested or inhaled (acutely toxic), and can cause skin and eye irritation. Use the 300μl multichannel pipette and add 250μl Buffer AW1 twice. This will require ~55mL of Buffer AW1 in a liquid boat.\nSeal the plate with a new AirPore tape sheet. Secure the DNeasy plate to the S-block with lab tape, and centrifuge in the Hughes centrifuge (7 min at 4500 rpm).\nRemove tape and carefully add 500μl of Buffer AW2 to each sample. Use the 300μl multichannel pipette and add 250μl twice. This will require ~55mL of Buffer AW2 in a liquid boat.\nSeal the plate with a new AirPore tape sheet and centrifuge at 4500 rpm for 20 min in the Hughes centrifuge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck spin column membrane\n\n\n\nSpin column membrane should be dry after this step. Spin for an additional 1 min if not.\n\n\n\nTransfer the DNeasy 96 plate to a rack of Elution Microtubes RS.\nElute the DNA by adding 200μl of Low TE Buffer to each sample using the 300μl multichannel pipette. We have found Low TE Buffer gives better yields than kit Buffer AE. For a full plate, this will require ~20mL of low TE. Seal with a new AirPore tape sheet & incubate for 10 min at room temperature (15–25°C). Secure the DNeasy plate to the Elution Microtubes with lab tape, and centrifuge in the Hughes centrifuge (3 min at 4500 rpm) or shared lab space centrifuge (4 min at 4400 rpm). Seal elution microtubes with new caps.\nAdd the elution buffer data to the app/database.\nLabel plate and extracted DNA can be placed in “No animals” fridge for a few days, or store at -20 or -80 for long term storage. AVOID numerous freeze-thaw cycles. Record time samples were put into the fridge/freezer in the app/datasheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtraction waste disposal\n\n\n\nExtraction buffers should be disposed of in their own hazardous waste container (not combined with ethanol, other liquid waste, etc.). Buffers AL/E, Proteinase K, and AW1 are hazardous. If you have leftovers of these, dispose of them in the hazardous waste container. Buffers ATL, AE, and AW2 are not hazardous and can be disposed of in the sink if they are uncontaminated leftovers and not used for extraction. At the end of the extraction, pour all of the liquid out of the S-Block into an 1000mL beaker and dispose of the contents in the dedicated hazardous waste container for extraction buffers. Check Qiagen material safety data sheets and type in catalog number 69581 for the plate extraction kit.",

    "text": "Wear gloves for all steps in this process. Do not touch door handles or computers with gloves on (unless the keyboard says “gloves only”).\n\n\n\nSample transfer: Samples will be in multiple boxes in freezer, but we only want to take a box out once to minimize sample degradation.\n\nFirst, develop a sample transfer plan which lists which samples in a given box will be going into which places on the tray. Work with Dr. Lotterhos to develop the plan.\nTake one box out of the freezer, transfer samples to appropriate location on the ordered trays.\n\nIf you are reusing S-blocks, ensure that they have been sterilized in an HCl bath and autoclaved prior to use. If they have not been or if you are unsure, follow this protocol. If you are using a kit for the first time, you do not need to sterilize/HCl bath the S-block, as it is already sterile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizing trays according to data plan\n\n\n\nSamples were randomized into different positions on different plates. There is a datasheet for this layout that was used to fill plates with corresponding samples. Pictures of the datasheet and organized samples are shown below.\nData plan for sample organization  Camille could you add a picture from your plate organization spreadsheet here? \nOrdered tray according to sample organization above \n\n\n\nIf any precipitate has formed in either the Buffer ATL or Buffer AL, warm solution(s) to 56 degrees C on the Isotemp or Thermomixer until precipitates have fully dissolved. The Isotemp is in the left corner of the pre-PCR counter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLab member roles during tissue lysis\n\n\n\nThis process goes smoothest with three lab members working at once. Two lab members should cut and weigh tissue samples, and read out or write down weights to the third lab member who will record them in the spreadsheet or app and place samples into corresponding collection tubes. It’s very easy to put tissue into the wrong collection tubes, so having one person committed to placing the samples into tubes is good. That person should also use the plastic sheet to avoid contamination.\n\n\n\nPrep surfaces and area around the scale. First clean with bleach solution, followed by DI H2O, then 70% EtOH.\nGet a styrofoam container with ice to keep tissue samples cool while prepping for extraction. Ice is located to the right of the sink in the gel room.\nRemove one plate of tissue from freezer and briefly thaw on counter (do not let them sit any longer than necessary). Once thawed they can be placed on ice (this generally won’t cause them to re-freeze).\nGet a tissue collection tube rack from Qiagen kit box. The clear tubes are already in a clear blue rack and have a clear lid over them.\nUse the EasyPet to add 18 mL Buffer ATL (note: hazardous if inhaled) to a 25 mL liquid boat (enough for 100 samples). Then add 180uL Buffer ATL to each tissue collection tube using the P300 multichannel pipette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips for pipetting\n\n\n\nSee page on Pipettes and Pipetting Tips for best pipetting practices and troubleshooting.\n\n\n\nFill a 50 mL falcon tube with 70% ethanol. Light the ethanol lamp using the lighter in the drawer in front of the scale. Sterilize your forceps, scalpel, and pokey stick before starting by dipping them in the ethanol and then running them through the lamp to burn the ethanol off. Be careful not to let the ethanol run down the handles of any equipment, or the flame will catch there too and you could burn yourself.\nTare piece of weighing paper on scale.\nCarefully remove tissue from 2mL tube using sterilized forceps. Place the tissue on a weigh boat to cut. Use a sterile scalpel blade to cut a piece of tissue roughly 20mg in weight (cut on weigh boat). Using 95% pure EtoH, gently rinse tissue in weigh boat and pat dry with clean Kim wipe, so that the tissue appears nearly dry.\nPlace tissue on weigh paper and measure the weight. If the tissue weighs 20mg+/-2mg place it in extraction tube, using the plastic sheet over the tube rack to only expose the tube you’re working with. If the tissue is not the correct weight, either remove tissue as necessary or add more from sample tissue. If adding more, make sure to rinse with EtOH and dry the new tissue. Then make sure the tissue is pushed all the way down into the buffer at the bottom of the collection tube.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNote: Make sure tissue is all the way at the bottom of the well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant: Prevent cross-contamination\n\n\n\nBetween samples, the scalpel & forceps should be sterilized by wiping with a Kimwipe to remove any remaining tissue, dipping in 70% EtoH, and using a flame to burn off any residual EtoH and tissue. Scalpels are very sharp, be very careful when wiping with a Kim wipe, as it’s very easy to cut yourself. Consider placing the Kim wipe on the counter, and wiping the scalpel off on it there. Sterilize plastic sheet between samples by spraying with 70% EtOH and wiping with a Kim wipe. Make sure to carefully clean the hole punch where samples may contact. Remake plastic sheet between plates.\n\n\n\nRecord tissue weight in lab notebook or app by well location, not by vial ID. Place sample into appropriate collection well plate (cyan plates). Keep plate covered with plastic sheet that has a hole in the center. This hole will expose one well at a time for tissue transfer. Sterilize plastic sheet between samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntering sample weights into the app\n\n\n\nOpen the Seascape Samples Extractions app on your laptop or lab iPad (passcode is 0156). Select the plate you are extracting from on the home page, then select the extraction entry for the current extraction. Scroll down to Extraction_mg_tissue and click “Add.” Enter data into all fields as prompted.\n\n\n\nWhen you are nearly finished with tissue cutting, preheat Thermo-mixer to 56°C. Make sure the plate attachment is on and not the tube attachment. If you need to switch attachments, push the blue button down to release the attachment.\nAdd 2 mL Proteinase K to a 25 mL liquid boat (enough for 100 samples). Once all samples have been cut and placed in collection tubes, pipette 20 uL Proteinase K into each sample tube.\nSeal wells with collection microtube caps from Qiagen kit, then place clear rack lid back on the tube rack. Use vortexer with plate attachment (shown below) to mix samples, then centrifuge using Hughes lab centrifuge or the large centrifuge in the shared molecular space for 20-30s at 4500 rpm if using Hughes centrifuge or 4400 rpm if using shared molecular space centrifuge, ensuring that a counter weight is placed into the centrifuge before starting. Add water to counter weight to account for differences in weight if necessary (Use practice extraction plate as counter weight.)\n\nVortexer plate attachment: \n\nPlace entire tube rack with individual tube caps and rack lid on Thermomixer set at 56°C at 600 rpm (we have plate attachment, but plates are too tall, so just put the sample plate on the mixer without the Thermomixer lid fully sealed. Still place the Thermomixer lid on the tube rack, it just won’t close all the way, and that’s okay). BEFORE STARTING THE MIXER: Make sure all tube caps are securely fastened. In addition, after 2 minutes on the thermo-mixer confirm the tube caps haven’t popped open.\nSamples can be left for at least 2 hours or overnight to allow for all tissue to be completely lysed. Samples can be in Thermomixer from the time the tissue prep is finished until you are ready to start the extraction first thing the following morning (usually ~ 2pm to 9am the following day).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Stop Points\n\n\n\nOnce you start the extraction process, there aren’t any good stopping points mid-protocol. Letting the DNA sit out for too long outside of incubation steps could lead to DNA degradation, so it’s important to keep the process moving once you start.\n\n\n\nPrep surfaces and area around the work bench. First clean with bleach solution, followed by DI H2O, then 70% EtoH.\nRemove the entire sample tube rack from the Thermomixer and ensure microtubes in the tube rack are properly sealed with their individual caps. Cover again with clear plastic lid and shake the tube rack vigorously by hand for 15 seconds. Then secure the lid to the rack with lab tape. Centrifuge in the Hughes lab centrifuge (30s at 4500 rpm) or the shared molecular space centrifuge (45s at 4400 rpm) to collect any solution from the caps. Hold down short spin button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuffer AL prep\n\n\n\nNote that buffer AL is a hazardous chemical (causes skin irritation and serious eye irritation). Ensure ethanol has been added to Buffer AL according to instructions on the container. The cap should be marked if ethanol has been added.\n\n\n\nUse 25 mL serological pipette tips with the Easy-Pet pipette to transfer 45 mL Buffer AL to a 50mL liquid boat (enough for a full plate of samples). Carefully remove sample caps and add 410 μl Buffer AL using the 300μL multichannel pipette (split this into two rounds of pipetting 205μl of Buffer AL, only go to the first stop to avoid bubbles). If you are careful not to touch the pipette tip to the sample tubes or another contaminated surface, you can put the same tip into the buffer multiple times to transfer the full volume. Tightly reseal with new caps.\nPlace clear cover over the rack and shake vigorously for 15s by hand. Secure the lid to the rack with lab tape, then centrifuge in the Hughes Lab centrifuge (30s at 4500 rpm) or shared lab space centrifuge (45s at 4400 rpm) to collect any solution from the caps. Make sure to add water to the counterweight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing counterweights\n\n\n\nFor every centrifuge step, you need a counterweight that is equal in weight and height to whatever sample plate you are spinning. We have an extra of almost every plate to use as a counterweight. When you add a new buffer to the sample plate, make sure to add the same volume of tap water to the counterweight to even out the weights. Use the scale to check the weights of the sample plate and counterweight before going over to the Hughes lab. They should be within a few grams of each other and the same height.\n\n\n\nPlace DNeasy 96 plate on the S-Block. Make sure well A1 is directly on top of well A1, etc. Note that the DNeasy plate on the S-block is very prone to tipping, especially when applying tape sheets. Be careful not to let them tip or lysate may slosh out and cause contamination between samples.\nCarefully remove caps from the collection microtubes & transfer all lysate of each sample to the corresponding wells on the DNeasy 96 plate using filtered tips. Our P200 filtered tips only fit on the P100 multichannel, so set the P100 multichannel pipette to 100 uL, and transfer all lysate in as many rounds as necessary to get as much as possible into the DNeasy plate. The lysate can get super bubbly, so be careful not to get any sample up into the actual pipette. There’s usually about 600 uL total lysate in each sample. Pop any bubbles using a pipette tip. Dispose of empty collection microtubes and blue tube rack in the mayo jar.\nSeal the plate with an AirPore tape sheet which comes with the Qiagen kit, then secure the DNeasy plate to the S-block with lab tape. Centrifuge in the Hughes centrifuge (13 min at 4500 rpm).\nRemove tape and carefully add 500μl of Buffer AW1 to each sample. AW1 is harmful if ingested or inhaled (acutely toxic), and can cause skin and eye irritation. Use the 300μl multichannel pipette and add 250μl Buffer AW1 twice. This will require ~55mL of Buffer AW1 in a liquid boat.\nSeal the plate with a new AirPore tape sheet. Secure the DNeasy plate to the S-block with lab tape, and centrifuge in the Hughes centrifuge (7 min at 4500 rpm).\nRemove tape and carefully add 500μl of Buffer AW2 to each sample. Use the 300μl multichannel pipette and add 250μl twice. This will require ~55mL of Buffer AW2 in a liquid boat.\nSeal the plate with a new AirPore tape sheet and centrifuge at 4500 rpm for 20 min in the Hughes centrifuge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck spin column membrane\n\n\n\nSpin column membrane should be dry after this step. Spin for an additional 1 min if not.\n\n\n\nTransfer the DNeasy 96 plate to a rack of Elution Microtubes RS.\nElute the DNA by adding 200μl of Low TE Buffer to each sample using the 300μl multichannel pipette. We have found Low TE Buffer gives better yields than kit Buffer AE. For a full plate, this will require ~20mL of low TE. Seal with a new AirPore tape sheet & incubate for 10 min at room temperature (15–25°C). Secure the DNeasy plate to the Elution Microtubes with lab tape, and centrifuge in the Hughes centrifuge (3 min at 4500 rpm) or shared lab space centrifuge (4 min at 4400 rpm). Seal elution microtubes with new caps.\nAdd the elution buffer data to the app/database.\nLabel plate and extracted DNA can be placed in “No animals” fridge for a few days, or store at -20 or -80 for long term storage. AVOID numerous freeze-thaw cycles. Record time samples were put into the fridge/freezer in the app/datasheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtraction waste disposal\n\n\n\nExtraction buffers should be disposed of in their own hazardous waste container (not combined with ethanol, other liquid waste, etc.). Buffers AL/E, Proteinase K, and AW1 are hazardous. If you have leftovers of these, dispose of them in the hazardous waste container. Buffers ATL, AE, and AW2 are not hazardous and can be disposed of in the sink if they are uncontaminated leftovers and not used for extraction. At the end of the extraction, pour all of the liquid out of the S-Block into an 1000mL beaker and dispose of the contents in the dedicated hazardous waste container for extraction buffers. Check Qiagen material safety data sheets and type in catalog number 69581 for the plate extraction kit.",

    "text": "Edit this page\nThese instructions will cover launching and connecting to jupyter notebooks on discovery. For launching jupyter notebooks on your laptop, the process is similar but instead of connecting to discovery you just execute: jupyter notebook. At the end of the page, there are instructions for using R within jupyter notebooks.\njupyter notebooks are basically like any session of R or python, but you can organize code and save the code’s output. You can also use “markdown” which is a handy way of manipulating font and typesetting. If you’re ever curious about markdown you can google markdown cheatsheet, or there is this tutorial as well as this cheatsheat.\nThese instructions assume that you’ve completed Advanced SSH-ing as well as Installing Anaconda including creating the mvp_env anaconda environment.\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of what a notebook looks like. This notebook is running python, but there are many languages that can be run - I’ll show you how to use R in these notebooks when I’m in town. You can see the markdown (in black at the very top) and the code (in gray cells) and code output below each cell. Having code set up this way means you can go anywhere in the notebook and run code, then scroll up and run code, then scroll elsewhere and run code. Because of this, the order of execution is recorded to the left of the cell - eg In [1] or In [2].\n\n\n\nfig1\n\n\nHaving code output saved alongside code is super super handy when going back to review or read code. Without the code output, you have to guess what the data looks like ‘behind the scenes’. With the code output you can leave yourself better clues as to what your code was doing. For example, previewing a data frame:\n\n\n\nfig2\n\n\nOr remembering which figure (filename) was created by which code:\n\n\n\nfig3\n\n\n\n\n\nTo run jupyter, you need to have a version of python installed (even if you want to only use R). Anaconda environments are built on python, so they come with python as one of the default installs when you create even “blank” environments. The default python will likely be a recent version (&gt;3.8) but you can also use jupyter on previous versions of python if you need to use another version.\nNormally you have to install jupyter via python. Python packages are installed with something called pip. We already have jupyter in the mvp_env, so we don’t have to do this, but for future reference do (after activating the environment) : pip install jupyter\nFor now, let’s just activate our environment: conda activate mvp_env - afterwards, you should be able to get a path returned from doing which jupyter:\n\n\n\nfig4\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning jupyter is pretty easy … except we installed jupyter on a remote server. Had we installed jupyter on our laptop, we would only need to run this command : jupyter notebook from terminal.\nHowever, if we run that command that on the server, our computer doesn’t know where to plug in our monitor to “listen” to that jupyter broadcast so we can actually see the notebooks. So we need to tell our computer where to listen. The “where” is what’s called a “port”, and ports are identified by numbers - we’ll stick to four-digit numbers.\nThe default port that jupyter broadcasts on is port 8888. Because of this, it is likely that we cannot rely on port 8888 to be available on servers (since other people may be running notebooks or other things). So I want you to pick a number between 8888-9999 - but it can’t be 9603 because that’s what I use :slightly_smiling_face: - if you run into any errors below with the ssh command, try another number.\nThe way we tell our computer where to listen on the server takes place during a ssh command using “port forwarding”. Previously we just did ssh discovery. To have your computer listen on port 9603 do: ssh -L 9603:localhost:9603 discovery (remember to use your own port number).\nThis command tells your computer to forward the server’s port 9603 to your computer’s 9603. Honestly, it’s just easier to keep both numbers before and after :localhost: the same number. Once executed, this command will open a ssh connection to discovery and the port forwarding will happen silently (you won’t be able to tell). This window needs to remain open and connected in order for the “listening” to be maintained (if it’s closed, then you won’t be able to connect to your jupyter session).\nWhen you’re doing this type of connection, you should make sure that you do not see the following message - this indicates that you aren’t able to “listen” on the port you want (ie it’s already in use) and you should pick another port. You will still connect to the server, so there is no “error” just the warning.\n\n\n\nfig5\n\n\nSince we’re not using the default port 8888, we also want jupyter to broadcast to the port we’re listening to (eg 9603). We want to launch the jupyter command in a new window (not our current “port forwarding” window) - so we’ll have two windows in total. But we also want to keep these two windows together, so while you have your “port forwarding” window open :\n\ngo to iTerm’s menubar: Shell &gt; Split Horizontally With Current Profile - this will (as you may expect) split the current window size to fit in another window. Note that the new window isn’t ssh-ed.\nin the new window do ssh discovery to connect. You will “land” on one of the login nodes - make sure you’re on the same login node as your other window (login-00 or login-01) - the terminal prompt as well as the iTerm window itself will display your current node. If you’re not on the same node, you can ssh from one node to the other: eg do ssh login-00 or ssh login-01\nthen activate mvp_env by doing conda activate mvp_env\nthen launch jupyter by doing jupyter notebook --no-browser --port 9603 (using your port)\n\n\n\n\nfig6\n\n\nIf you’ve installed iTerm for macOS and if you click on the top window with the jupyter command, and hold the ‘command’ key, you can scroll over the http:localhost link and it will become click-able. Click it, and you should see a file browser with the contents of your home directory.\nIf your browser says it can’t connect - double check to make sure your “listening” window didn’t have warnings about busy ports, and that you used the same port in the ssh -L command AND the jupyter launch command. If all else fails: close all of your windows, choose another port and redo the substeps above.\n\n\n\nfig7\n\n\nTo actually launch a jupyter notebook, you click the New drop down menu and then python3. This should open a new browser tab with the notebook (with a default Untitled filename which you can edit either within the notebook or on the file browser page).\n\n\n\nfig10\n\n\nNote we don’t want to run jupyter on the login-node (this is where you “land” when you initially ssh) - in the how to launch and connect to a jupyter notebook on one of the compute nodes.\nTo stop your jupyter command you can do ‘control + c’ (and respond ‘y’ to confirm), or close the jupyter command window.\n\n\n\nWhen you initially ssh to discovery, you “land” on one of the two login nodes: either login-00 or login-01. You should see which one in your terminal prompt (see screenshots above). Running programs (including jupyter) on the login nodes (on any server) is usually “taboo” since resources are limited and all users will “land” here. So we want to use the compute nodes on discovery to actually run our notebook (which will run our code).\n\n\nBefore we do this, it will be useful to consider how our terminal windows will be arranged. In the following instructions we will have two ssh connections to discovery: - In the first window we will 1) connect to discovery via ssh discovery, 2) connect to the compute node, and 3) launch jupyter - In the second window we will connect to discovery using port forwarding described above (eg ssh -L 9603:localhost:9603 discovery).\nLet’s first open two sessions to use, and combine them. - Using iTerm, hit ‘command + n’ to open a new window (or from the menu bar: Shell &gt; New Window). This will be referred to as Window #1. - Next we’re going to split the window to add another pane (i.e., BASH session). To add a second pane in the same window - using the menu bar: Shell &gt; Split Horizontally with Current Profile. This will be referred to as Window #2. - We put both of these sessions/panes in the same window so that we can eventually minimize it to the dock. We don’t ever want to close the jupyter notebook, nor do we want to close the port forwarding window that allows us to view the jupyter broadcast.\n\n\n\nfig11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst connect to discovery: ssh discovery.\nSimilar to how we launched jupyter on the login nodes, we will launch jupyter once connected to the compute nodes. To do so so that we can use jupyter, we need to launch an “interactive job”. The following command will request 1 CPU for 8 hours from the lotterhos partition (a partition where lab members get priority for computing resources).\nsrun -p lotterhos -N 1 --time=8:00:00 --pty /bin/bash\nIt may take some time to connect, and if the partition is busy it won’t connect until any currently running jobs are done. Ask Katie if you need clarification. If it’s taking too long you could try the “short” partition and use -p short instead of -p lotterhos. Once you’ve been granted resources, you should see a message like srun: job 33302314 has been allocated resources\nOnce connected, activate the anconda environment that has jupyter: eg conda activate mvp_env (note you could just add this line to the notebook.sh file below before the jupyter command)\nNow that we’re connected, we actually need to run several lines of commands in Window #1 for everything to work properly. Instead of running these commands every time we want to connect to jupyter on a compute node, let’s put them all into a single file. - first let’s create a file in the source directory: vim ~/src/notebook.sh - if there’s an error, the source directory likely doesn’t exist, so create it: do mkdir ~/src - Using vim will open a file for editing. Once opened, paste the following text into the file. After pasting, hit esc then :wq (note :) then hit enter to save the file.\necho \"launching on port $1\"\n\nssh -N -f -R $1:localhost:$1 login-00\nssh -N -f -R $1:localhost:$1 login-01\n\ncd $HOME/code\njupyter notebook --no-browser --port $1\n\nThe contents of the file at ~/src/notebook.sh do the following:\n\nit will first print (echo) the port we chose to use (see below for file usage)\nthen it will open a connection to each of the login nodes (ssh -N ...) from the compute node (see instructions for Window #2 below). This is basically telling the compute node to broadcast the notebook at your port on each of the login nodes.\nchange to a folder where we save our notebooks cd $HOME/code - note you may want to change this path, as it probably doesn’t exist in your directories\nthen launch jupyter using port we chose\n\nOnce the file at ~/src/notebook.sh is saved we need to make it “executable” so we can eventually execute all of the lines within it at once whenever we want to launch jupyter. To do so do : chmod +x ~/src/notebook.sh\n\nIf you ls ~/src/notebook.sh the file should now show up as green\n\nNow we can run this file like it was a program. To use this file we run something like: ~/src/notebook.sh 9603 or if in the src directory: ./notebook 9603\n\nNote we added 9603 to the execution command. The “9603” is a “trailing argument” which is a common way to tell a program (BASH/shell, R, python, etc) to use a certain variable. In shell file, where ever you see $1 you can pretend as if it’s actually “9603”.\nExecuting the file should eventually bring up a link to connect, but first we need to tell our computer where to listen to the jupyter broadcast (see Window #2 instructions).\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we have our jupyte broadcast being forwarded to each of the login nodes, it doesn’t matter which one we connect to. But we do need to tell our computer to listen for these broadcasts using the port number above (eg 9603). Simple execute the following in Window #2 ssh -L 9603:localhost:9603 discovery (using your port number). Now go back to Window #1, hold the ‘command’ key and click the http://localhost link. This should open up a file browswer as we saw when launching juypyter on the login node.\n\n\n\nYour windows should look more or less like this:\n\n\n\nfig12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing to keep in mind - where ever you execute the jupyter notebook … command is where this ‘file browser’ will open. Some times this may not be ideal - eg if you save notebooks in a different directory other than home. So you could either create a symlink in your home directory so you can get to your notebooks faster or you can just launch the jupyter command from the notebooks directory. - on a mac, a symlink is called an alias and you can create aliases by right-clicking folders and files then drag the alias anywhere you want.\nI recommend having all code for all projects under one directory (or at least having a single directory that symlinks all of your coding directories). This one directory can have multiple subdirectories with an arbitrary number of sub-subdirectories (so you don’t have to save all notebooks in a single directory).\nFor instance I have a directory for all code, then a subdirectory for my current work (MVP-offsets):\n\n\n\nfig8\n\n\nand sub-subdirectories within MVP-offsets:\n\n\n\nfig9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing jupyter for its native languages can be very powerful. However, you may want to use R. Well you can! To use R with jupyter we need an R environment.\nWhen thinking about the setup - you will need an R environment at minimum. You can run jupyter from this environment, or run jupyter in another environment and still be able to use the R version in jupyter.\nAfter you have an active R environment (eg conda activate r_4.0_env), you will need to install a version (&gt;v3.6) of python (if it’s not already - conda envs will have python installed). After isntalling python, use pip to install the python jupyter package pip install jupyter.\nNext open R, then in the R session do install.packages('IRkernel').\nNext you will decide how you want your R environment to display in Jupyter. Here is a screenshot of some of the R environments I have set up.\n\n\n\nfig13\n\n\nIn the following command, the displayname is what is shown in the figure above. The name argument should be similar to the display name; name is used in the background for naming filesystems. Since you may have multiple R environments each set up for a specific purpose, including the purpose may be helpful.\nIRkernel::installspec(name = 'ir40_purpose', displayname = 'R 4.0 purpose')\nThen in whichever environment you run jupyter, you should be able to see your R version to run notebooks.\n\n\n\nfig14",

    "text": "Here is an example of what a notebook looks like. This notebook is running python, but there are many languages that can be run - I’ll show you how to use R in these notebooks when I’m in town. You can see the markdown (in black at the very top) and the code (in gray cells) and code output below each cell. Having code set up this way means you can go anywhere in the notebook and run code, then scroll up and run code, then scroll elsewhere and run code. Because of this, the order of execution is recorded to the left of the cell - eg In [1] or In [2].\n\n\n\nfig1\n\n\nHaving code output saved alongside code is super super handy when going back to review or read code. Without the code output, you have to guess what the data looks like ‘behind the scenes’. With the code output you can leave yourself better clues as to what your code was doing. For example, previewing a data frame:\n\n\n\nfig2\n\n\nOr remembering which figure (filename) was created by which code:\n\n\n\nfig3\n\n\n\n\n\nTo run jupyter, you need to have a version of python installed (even if you want to only use R). Anaconda environments are built on python, so they come with python as one of the default installs when you create even “blank” environments. The default python will likely be a recent version (&gt;3.8) but you can also use jupyter on previous versions of python if you need to use another version.\nNormally you have to install jupyter via python. Python packages are installed with something called pip. We already have jupyter in the mvp_env, so we don’t have to do this, but for future reference do (after activating the environment) : pip install jupyter\nFor now, let’s just activate our environment: conda activate mvp_env - afterwards, you should be able to get a path returned from doing which jupyter:\n\n\n\nfig4\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning jupyter is pretty easy … except we installed jupyter on a remote server.

    "text": "Edit this page\nSo, (Captain America pulls up a chair) you’ve accidentally sucked some sample up into the pipette comb, contaminating the inside of the pipette. You can’t keep using that pipette without possibly contaminating other samples. Not to worry, you can disassemble, decontaminate, autoclave, and reassemble the pipette. Here’s how.\nReference: Eppendorf Pipettes User Manual\n\n\n\nLabel the pipette with tape that says it’s contaminated and the date of contamination to let other lab members know not to use it.\nHang the pipette seperately from the uncontaminated ones. You can hang it off one of the lab shelves above the benches.\n\n\n\n\nRef. pages: 21-29\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the pipette volume to the highest end of its range (the nominal value)\n\n\nFor example, on the 20-300 uL pipette, set the volume to 300 uL\n\n\nThere’s a lever at the base of where the pipette handle meets the lower part with the combs. Push it to one side and hold it there to remove the lower part from the handle.\n\n\n\nOn the right and left sides of the lower part, there are two locking mechanisms. With the lower part hanging combs-down, push both locking mechanisms down. You can now remove the cover plate of the pipette combs.\n\n\n\nWhen you open the pipette, you’ll see the row of tip cones with pistons. Gently remove each piston. First pull the top of the piston forward, then pull it up and out of the tip cone.\n\n\n\nRemove the tip cones. Push one cone up into the pipette until you can pull the bottom part of the cone forward and out of the rack. The cones are spring-loaded, so do this step slowly to avoid the cone being flung out of the rack.\n\n\n\nPull the rest of the tip cone along with the spring out of the rack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a kimwipe, gently wipe any grease off of the pistons.\nPlace the tip cones and pistons in a 10% bleach bath for 30 min. See this protocol for how to make the bath. 100 mL of the bath placed in one of the larger plastic weigh boats should be enough to submerge the pipette parts.\n\n\nRemove the springs from the tipcones before placing the cones in the bath. Bleach causes metal to rust, so don’t put the springs in the bath.\n\n\nMake sure all cones and pistons are completely submerged and that the interiors of the cones have no air bubbles. Generally, if the cones are sitting on the bottom of the boat and aren’t floating, there likely aren’t bubbles in them. If they’re floating, try to gently tap the cone against the bottom of the boat to release bubbles.\nAfter 30 min, remove the cones and pistons from the bath and rinse them well in DI water.

Measure out the same volume of water several times in a row and see if its mass is within that error range of the true mass.\n\nFor example, if measuring out 300 uL water, measure out that volume of water several times in a row to see if the mass comes out to 298 mg - 302 mg consecutively.\n\nIf you can do this, the pipette does not need to be recalibrated.

    "text": "Edit this page\nThese are instructions for setting up a package management software called Anaconda on Discovery (or more generally any computer).\nBelow, if I want you to execute a terminal command, I’ll preface the command with “do” - eg “do ls”.\nMost of us got started programming using the R app or RStudio. Unless things have changed, we were only able to use one version of R at a time. When I used them, I wasn’t able to have multiple versions installed (even if used one at a time).\nHowever, in “practice” we may want to be able to use many versions of eg R at the exact same time (or at least the option to choose among versions), or install a workspace that is the same as it is somewhere else so that when we run code we don’t have to worry about program/package version differences affecting results. This is where Anaconda is really handy. If you’ve ever had to install terminal programs outside of a package manager or GUI install, you’ll know about the ‘dependency hell’ which is when you try to install something only to find out you need to install yet another version of this other program/package to work. And then find out about a dependency for the dependency. And so on. Anaconda helps sidestep this almost entirely, and makes creating new and multiple ‘environments’ a lot easier.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, do ssh discovery to connect to Discovery server (see here for advanced ssh-ing instructions).\n\n\n\nWhen installing software, it’s generally convention to keep the “source code” in a folder called src in the home directory. If you don’t have it, create it: do mkdir ~/src\nThen, change to the home directory: do cd ~/src\n\n\n\nIn a web browser, navigate to anaconda’s website.

Hit enter.\nI think I remember there eventually being a prompt to instantiate conda in your ~/.bashrc. This will allow you to use anaconda when opening a new terminal tab/window/session (note you need to open a new window or do source ~/.bashrc for it to take effect).

Normally $USER would be your username but written out, but we can use the $USER alias object since it will retrieve your username (try this by itelf echo $USER - this is your username on the system).\nAfter opening a new terminal window/tab or sourcing ~/.bashrc, you should be able to get a path returned from which conda.\n\n\n\nfig1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Anaconda environment is a set of specific software and software versions + some hardware stuff that we really don’t have to worry about.

    "title": "Collecting Samples for RNA",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Edit this page\nThe protocol for collecting samples for RNA extraction\n\n\n\nWith next generation sequencing, it is important to consider all sources of possible contamination when collecting samples. It is also important to consider the study question. For example, best results for RNA extraction will come from flash-frozen tissue or tissue stored in RNA-later. It is important to consider the source tissue (because of tissue-specific expression) when designing an experiment with RNA.\nA good resource is the RNA-seqlopedia and our RNA-seq page.\n\nRNAases will “eat” DNA and they are everywhere. Use a sterilized surface. Sterilize surface with 10% bleach or UV light, then use RNAase Away to clean the surface.\nRNA degrades in as little as 30 seconds, so tissues should be harvested quickly.\nUse sterile blades and switch the blade between samples.\nAll centrifuge tubes used to store tissues should be sterilized and prepared before going out. In general, it is best practice to have tubes organized in a box, with at least 2 labels on each tube (in case one falls off). We have a special barcode label printer (with freezer-proof labels) that can be used.\n\n\n\n\n\nScalpels with replaceable, sterile blades\nAutoclaved glass pyrex dish for cutting sample on and a flame to torch it; alternatively can use weigh boats that are RNAase/DNAase free\nAutoclaved tweezers, probes, etc. Ideally use tweezers without the ridges, between which tissue gets stuck.\nEthanol in an autoclaved beaker for rinsing dissecting tools\nA small flame for sterilizing dissecting tools between samples\nPrepared, Autoclaved and labeled (with EtOH-proof pen) microcentrifuge tube(s)\nRNA-ase away to wipe off surfaces and blades between samples\nNitex gloves\n\n\n\n\nWe use Fisher cryovials (#10-500-26), although note that they are really not designed to put into liquid N2. They work well for short-term storage in liquid N2 and then transfer to the -80C.\n\n\n\nWe have successfully placed tissue in RNAlater and flash frozen, with good results for RNA extraction.\nIf the tissue cannot be flash frozen in RNAlater, than it is important to:\n(1) Get the tissue:RNAlater ratio correct following manufacturer’s directions: Trim the tissue to be less than 0.5 cm in at least one dimension and simply submerge it in 5 volumes of RNAlater solution (e.g., a 0.5 g sample requires about 2.5 mL of RNAlater solution).\n(2) Keep the tissue at the correct temperature following the manufacturer’s direction for the specified amount of time before transferring to -80C.

    "text": "With next generation sequencing, it is important to consider all sources of possible contamination when collecting samples. It is also important to consider the study question. For example, best results for RNA extraction will come from flash-frozen tissue or tissue stored in RNA-later. It is important to consider the source tissue (because of tissue-specific expression) when designing an experiment with RNA.\nA good resource is the RNA-seqlopedia and our RNA-seq page.\n\nRNAases will “eat” DNA and they are everywhere. Use a sterilized surface. Sterilize surface with 10% bleach or UV light, then use RNAase Away to clean the surface.\nRNA degrades in as little as 30 seconds, so tissues should be harvested quickly.\nUse sterile blades and switch the blade between samples.\nAll centrifuge tubes used to store tissues should be sterilized and prepared before going out. In general, it is best practice to have tubes organized in a box, with at least 2 labels on each tube (in case one falls off). We have a special barcode label printer (with freezer-proof labels) that can be used.",

A lot of the times the author either doesn’t know how to write the markdown or they use incompatible syntax and so the document they will send you is a word document, or a text document with incorrect syntax.\nWhen the post looks good on my repository, I move it to the RCN-ECS github: https://github.com/RCN-ECS/rcn-ecs.github.io\nThe figure files go in ‘Img’\nThe text file goes in ’_posts’\nthen check https://rcn-ecs.github.io/blog/ to see if it updated properly – it takes some time (a few minutes) to show up.\n\nOnce it shows up, I email the author back to let them know it is published, ask them to double-check for any last-minute edits and tell them you’ll tweet the post (ask for their Twitter handle if they want to be tagged). My default email:\n\nThank you- your post has been published!\nENTER A LINK TO THEIR POST HERE\nIf you see anything that needs editing, please let me know.\nI will tweet your post through the network's account.

The pre-survey can be found here.\nAny questions or problems, please let me know!\nThank you again, and looking forward to your tweets!\nBest,\nThais\n\nOn Friday, before their week begins:\n\nUse https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/ to:\n\nGive participant access to the acccount: Accounts &gt; Manage team &gt; Add a team member (enter their twitter handle and send invitation to collaborate) &gt; Authorize.\nTweet their participation - I usually schedule a tweet for Monday AM (~8AM) using the provided bio. Welcome the participant, use their name and their twitter handle – often need to edit/shorten the bio. &gt; Of course, you can do that on Monday AM without scheduling on tweetdeck, if you prefer.\n\n\nOn Monday, I usually wait until they tweet for the first time to swap out the profile figure - edit profile and upload their pic to use as profile pic for the week.\nEnd of the week (Friday 5pm or later if they requested more time):\n\n\nTerminate access to the account: https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/ &gt; Accounts &gt; Team Members &gt; Change role &gt; Remove from team\nTake down their profile pic and upload RCN logo.\nSend a thank you note and the post-survey link to the participant via email.\n\nthank you again for your contribution to the RCN-ECS Twitter takeover last week! I hope you had fun!\nTo complement the pre-survey, we're asking our contributors to fill out a short post survey so that we can better assess their experience, and improve it for future contributors.\nThe post survey can be found here.\nThanks and all the best,\nThais"

    "section": "General Practices for -80 Freezer Organization",
    "text": "General Practices for -80 Freezer Organization\n\nMaking a New Freezer Box\n\nUse the Freezer App to add a box in the “All Boxes” table.\nGenerate info about your box. The BoxID should follow the template Box80_XXXX. The last box label will come up in the app, so use the next number in line (e.g. if the last label was Box80_145, then label your box Box80_146). Use the printed freezer labels (available in a ziploc bag on the front door of the -80) to attach information to each box as a sticker. Fill out the label according to the following template and update all fields in the app.\n\n\n\n\nAll data about the freezer box should be written on the sticky label and added to the app\n\n\n\nDecide where to store your box - click on the “Open Locations” tab in the Freezer App and choose a location. Before you open the freezer, use the -80 map below to familiarize yourself with the location. Do not allow the freezer door to hang open. Open the freezer and store your box! Make sure to connect the box with the location in the Freezer App- there are different ways to do this. (1) You can click on “All Boxes” table, search for your box and click on it. Scroll down add “Add” a related box-location. (2) You can click on the “Open Locations” table and search for your location and click on it. Scroll down and “Add” a related box-location. (3) You can click on the “Quick Add/Delete” table and add the location and box - but be careful, if your box was in a different location before, if you add another location the box could be in two locations!\n\n\n\n\n-80 Freezer map shows the location of shelves, columns, and drawers\n\n\n\nMake sure all data looks complete by checking the Freezer Database. If so, you’re good to go!\nLarge boxes or bags may have multiple locations associated with them. Conversely, a location might be associated with multiple items, such as really small plates.\n\n\n\nDeleting & Removing a Freezer Box\n\nWhen deleting a freezer box, use the Freezer App “All Boxes” table to find your box and do TWO ACTIONS: (1)Change the “Discarded” option to TRUE AND (2) delete the location affiliated with the box at the bottom under “related box-locations” (you can click on it and then click on the trash icon to delete it). This section action will make the location available for a new box.\nMake sure all data looks updated by checking the App (e.g., in most cases the box should only have one location associated with it) and the Freezer Database. If so, you’re good to go!\n\n\n\nUpdating Old or Falling Off Labels on Freezer Boxes\n\nThe adhesive doesn’t work well when the box is cold and/or wet. If you have a freezer box with a label that keeps falling off, replace the lid of the box with a new dry lid that has a new label on it. Fill out a new sticky label (found on the -80 door) with all of the same information. If you don’t change any of the information on the box, there’s no need to update the app. If you want to add a note (e.g. box is close to empty, samples are mostly used), add that new information to the app using the All Boxes list to locate your box.\n\n\n\nAdding a Freezer Box/Bag that takes up multiple locations\nExample scenario: You’d like to add some large plates to the database that are stored outside of the metal organizers and exist in “column 5” open space.\n\nRemove ‘available’ locations in the Freezer Database to reflect only the “bottom drawer” rows of column 5.\nAdd all of the “bottom drawer” locations to be affiliated with the one freezer box. You can add several location attributes to one freezer box or bag in the app. These locations should all appear as green colored text in the app, and the locations around that are ‘not available’ will be in black text.",

    "text": "Clean Out Notes, May 21 2024 (Katie, Madeline, Camille, Lee)\n\nThe first thing we did is review the New Freezer App and located any unmapped boxes or boxes that we want to discard. We also checked the data Freezer Database Spreadsheet. Katie can approve access to the Freezer App and Database.\nWhen we first opened the freezer, Katie scraped the ice from all of the shelf doors and handles. We had some ice build up around the seal, so we brushed it gently. When removing ice from the seal, do NOT use the sharp edge of the blade, this can cause nicks in the seal. We removed as much excess frost as possible.\n\n\n\n\nKatie scraping ice off of the shelf doors\n\n\n\n\n\nScrape the ice fully off of the doors\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to be very careful near the seals, do not make nicks with the sharp edge\n\n\n\nThen we discarded boxes that we didn’t have any data for (Unmapped Boxes section in app). One trick for opening shelves that are tightly sealed from the frost is to use the ice scraper like a crowbar (wiggle up and down, then pull the shelf out).\n\n\n\n\nUse the ice scraper to help remove stubborn frozen drawers\n\n\n\nWhen we removed the boxes from the freezer, we removed all tape and labels, disposed of vials in the trash, and left the old boxes out to thaw. For this part, it was helpful to have one person on the data calling out the box numbers, one person at the freezer pulling out the shelves and placing them in a cooler on ice, and a third & fourth person emptying the vials, pulling off the tape, and stacking the boxes. Confirm each box was correctly removed from the app before tossing the vials.\n\n\n\n\nLet the empty boxes dry out after removing from freezer. Remove all tape labels.\n\n\n\nWe consolidated bags as much as possible, changing the “Discard” status to TRUE for bags and boxes that no longer exist. This keeps a record of the boxes that were discarded.\nWe went through the freezer shelf-by-shelf and made sure that boxes were stored in their proper location. We found more boxes that we wanted to toss (any without data, some from old projects) and removed them from the freezer database, changing the “Discard” status to TRUE. We moved some boxes up to empty rows.\nKatie de-iced the internal temperature probes (located on shelf 2 & shelf 3 next to column 5) - be sure to do this regularly!!",

Do this one shelf at the time until the freezer is empty.\n\n\nTransfer racks in and out of freezers carefully but quickly to minimize temp rising - note that the drawers slide open, so keep the racks horizontal; monitor both freezer’s temp as you transfer - shouldn’t rise above -65oC.\n\n\nOnce empty:\n\n\nPut up a “wet floor” sign,\nClose the CO2 cylinder valve,\nSwitch off the local alarm box located on top of the freezer,\nUnlock the switch locking plate (front-bottom-right side of the freezer) and switch off the battery (top) and the main (bottom) switches,\nUnplug the freezer from the wall,\nOpen all doors and let the freezer defrost, use a bucket to catch water dripping from the doors, use a mop to dry up the puddles.\n\n\nOnce defrosted: wipe the whole interior of the freezer, the inner and outer doors and the seal using clean microfiber cloths (under the lab sink) until completely dry.\nReverse to bring freezer back up: close all doors, plug freezer back up, switch on main switch/battery switch and lock up the locking plate, switch on alarm box up on top of the freezer. Monitor temperature to ensure that it is appropriately decreasing all the way to -80oC.\n\n\nDuring this stage, the freezer alarm may go off (not the alarms associated with the remote system), just mute it using the door pannel keys.\n\n\n\nRefill our freezer\nNote: (At least 24h after temp is back to -80oC on the empty freezer)\n\nDisable our freezer alarm for 1h (instructions above). Set a timer for yourself for 55 min because you might need to extend alarm cancellation. Check with the host lab on whether the alarm on the backup freezer needs to be disabled.\nWEARING FREEZER MITTENS Transfer freezer racks back and ensure they are placed back on the freezer position (shelf & row) where they before - so it continues to match the freezer database. Leave one or two empty racks in the freezer for new boxes. Monitor The temperature of both freezers during retrieval to ensure it does not raise above 65oC.\nIf you need to take a break to allow the temperature to drop, remember to extend the alarm cancellation for another hour.\nOnce all samples are back, wait around and make sure that the freezer temp drops down to -80oC.\n\n\n\nExample timeline:\nOctober 2021 defrost (Thais, Sara and Alan):\n\nOGL was able to hold our samples (MUST coordinate with OGL personnel ahead of time); OGL’s freezers was completely empty, and shelves have the same dimensions as ours (plus an extra shelf); their freezer was not hooked up to an alarme system at the time.\nWe were able to transfer all racks to the equivalent positions into the backup freezer (one shelf at the time) without needing to wait too long for the temperature to stabilize. Because the backup freezer was empty, the temp rose to -58oC when we transferred the first shelf/5 racks.\nOur freezer was defrosted, cleaned/dried and turned back on within 2 hours.\nTransfer-defrost-cleaning took from 11am to 2pm.\nTemp down to -80oC within another 2-3 hours (all done by 5pm).\nThe CO2 valve was reopened the following day.\nThe following week, we transferred the racks back. Temp went up to 65oC after 3 shelves were tranferred so we took 1h break, then tranferred the remaining racks and samples.\nTook about 2h for the temp to go back down to -80oC (freezer alarm went off once).",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Edit this page\n\nVS Code and Pycharm are both Integrated Developement Environments, or IDEs. You’ve probably worked with an IDE, RStudio is an IDE. Ultimately the purpose of an IDE is to make coding easier. Some of the most basic features of IDEs are syntax highlighting and autocompletion capabilities, but they can also do a lot more than that - like displaying hover-over metadata (eg displaying a function’s documentation when hovering over code), jumping to the part of the file where a function is defined/used, showing where an error will occur, among others. While PyCharm is specifically built for python (but see other IDEs from jet brains), VS Code supports hundreds of coding languages.\nBoth PyCharm and VS Code have free professional versions for students and academics - see eg here for PyCharm. I won’t say much more about the purposes and cool features of these IDEs, for that it would be good to google, use the intro/how-to resources from each program’s page, or better yet open one up and explore.\nThe purpose of this post is to show how to set up VS Code and PyCharm to connect to NEU’s Discovery cluster.\n\nFirst download and install the program by visiting the landing pages linked above.\nMake sure you can ssh to discovery - in terminal ssh user@discovery.neu.edu\n\nTODO - link to example of ssh config\nto set up passwordless ssh so you don’t have to enter a password each time, see this link\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the Remote Development Extensionpack\n\n\n\nOnce the Remote Development Extension is installed, open the Command Palette (⇧⌘P) and type “Remote-SSH: Connect to Host…” and you should see something like this\n\n\n\nAfter a moment, VS Code will connect to the SSH server and set itself up. VS Code will keep you up-to-date using a progress notification. After you are connected, you’ll be in an empty window. You can always refer to the Status bar to see which host you are connected to.\n\n\n\nYou should now be able to choose the folder you wish to open\n\n\n\nAfter opening the folder destination you can begin to create new files or open that already exist\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter setting up a project first add the Remote Host tool window to the sidebar\n\n\n\nIf PyCharm opens the Remote Host tool window like a browser tab, you can drag it to the sidebar. Afterwards, click on it. Then click on the ... next to the drop down menu. In the Deployment window, click the + button to add a new SFTP connection. This will then prompt you to give a server name, let’s use “discovery”.\n\n\n\nNext we need to set up the SSH Configuration - click the ... next to the SSH Configuration drop-down menu. Fill in your credentials. I have passwordless ssh already configured (how-to link above) so I have selected to authenticate using my RSA key. Make sure to test the connection.\n\n\n\nClose the SSH Configuration window to return to the Deployment window. Test the connection in the Deployment window. After a successful connection, close the Deployment window and select ‘discovery’ from the Remote Host drop-down menu. You should now be able to browse files on the remote server.",

This kit includes all the enzymes and buffers required for cDNA library preparation from isolation of poly(A)-tailed RNA. Kits include reagents for RNA fragmentation, 1st strand cDNA synthesis and 2nd strand synthesis/marking, and cDNA library preparation, including A-tailing, ligation and library amplification.\nSteps in Library construction (Here I just want to be explicit where we use their reagents and where we use our reagents):\n\nmRNA capture using magnetic oligo-dT beads\nFragmentation using heat and magnesium\n1st Strand cDNA Synthesis using random priming\n2nd Strand cDNA Synthesis and marking, which converts the cDNA:RNA hybrid to double-stranded cDNA (dscDNA) and incorporates dUTP in the second cDNA strand\nA-tailing to add dAMP to the 3′-ends of the dscDNA library fragments\nAdapter ligation, where dsDNA adapters with 3′-dTMP overhangs are ligated to A-tailed library insert fragments (HERE WE USE CUSTOM ADAPTERS, SEE BELOW)\nLibrary amplification to amplify library fragments carrying appropriate adapter sequences at both ends using high-fidelity, low-bias PCR; the strand marked with dUTP is not amplified.\n\n\n\n\nAnnealing buffer stock (10X):\n\n\n\nComponent\nConcentration\n\n\n\n\nTris HCl, pH 8\n100 mM\n\n\nNaCl\n500 mM\n\n\nEDTA\n10 mM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJon can you add a figure here on the adapters… Illumina calls P1 P5 and P2 P7… just to avoid confusion for the eventual user of this protocol.\n\n\n\nOligo Name\nSequence\n\n\n\n\nRNA_P2.1_H3\nP*CAAGCTTAGATCGGAAGAGCGAGAACAA\n\n\nRNA_P2.1_NC\nP*CCCATGGAGATCGGAAGAGCGAGAACAA\n\n\nRNA_P2.1_SA\nP*CGTCGACAGATCGGAAGAGCGAGAACAA\n\n\nRNA_P2.1_BS\nP*CTGTACAAGATCGGAAGAGCGAGAACAA\n\n\nRNA_P2.2_H3\nGTGACTGGAGTTCACACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTTTCGAAG*T\n\n\nRNA_P2.2_NC\nGTGACTGGAGTTCACACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTGGTACCG*T\n\n\nRNA_P2.2_SA\nGTGACTGGAGTTCACACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTCAGCTGG*T\n\n\nRNA_P2.2_BS\nGTGACTGGAGTTCACACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTACATGTG*T\n\n\nRNA_P1.1_H3\nACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTAAGCTTG*T\n\n\nRNA_P1.1_NC\nACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTCCATGGG*T\n\n\nRNA_P1.1_SA\nACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTGTCGACG*T\n\n\nRNA_P1.1_BS\nACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTTGTACAG*T\n\n\nRNA_P1.2_H3\nP*CTTCGAAATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT\n\n\nRNA_P1.2_NC\nP*CGGTACCATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT\n\n\nRNA_P1.2_SA\nP*CCAGCTGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT\n\n\nRNA_P1.2_BS\nP*CACATGTATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle-stranded oligos need to be annealed with their appropriate partner before ligation.\n\nTo create Adapter P1, combine each oligo 1.1 with its complementary oligo 1.2 in a 1:1 ratio in working strength annealing buffer (final buffer concentration 1x) for a total annealed adapter concentration of 40uM (for example, if purchased oligos are resuspended to an initial concentration of 100uM, use 40ul oligo 1.1, 40ul oligo 1.2, 10ul 10x annealing buffer and 10ul nuclease-free water). Do the same for oligos 2.1 and 2.2 to create the common adapter P2.\n\n\nIn a thermocyler, incubate at 97.5°C for 2.5 minutes, and then cool at a rate of not greater than 3°C per minute until the solution reaches a temperature of 21°C. Hold at 4°C.\nPrepare final working strength concentrations of annealed adapters from this annealed stock (the appropriate working stock dilution for your experiment can be determined from our ligation molarity calculator-WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO ADD DETAILS). For convenience, it is possible to store the adapters at 4°C while in active use.\n\nProcedure: * Prepare mastermixes for 4 libraries * See tables in manual and tables below for guidelines:\n\n\n\nComponent\nTotal Volume Needed for 4 RXNs\n\n\n\n\n1st Strand Synthesis Master Mix:\n–\n\n\n1st Strand Synthesis Buffer\n22 μl\n\n\nKAPA Script\n2 μl\n\n\nTotal Master Mix Volume\n24 μl\n\n\nFinal reaction composition:\n–\n\n\n1st Strand Synthesis Master Mix\n5 μl\n\n\nFragmented, primed RNA\n10 μl\n\n\nTotal Reaction Volume\n15 μl\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nTotal Volume Needed for 4 RXNs\n\n\n\n\n2nd Strand Synthesis and Marking Master Mix:\n–\n\n\n2nd Strand Marking Buffer\n62 μl\n\n\n2nd Strand Synthesis Enzyme Mix\n4 μl\n\n\nTotal Master Mix Volume\n66 μl\n\n\nFinal reaction composition:\n–\n\n\n2nd Strand Synthesis and Marking Master Mix\n15 μl\n\n\nFragmented, primed RNA\n15 μl\n\n\nTotal Reaction Volume\n30 μl\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nTotal Volume Needed for 4 RXNs (10% excess)\n\n\n\n\nA-Tailing Master Mix:\n–\n\n\nWater\n52.8 μl\n\n\n10X KAPA A-Tailing Buffer\n6.6 μl\n\n\nKAPA A-Tailing Enzyme\n6.6 μl\n\n\nTotal Master Mix Volume\n66 μl\n\n\nResuspend beads in a volume of:\n** 15 μl**\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nTotal Volume Needed for 4 RXNs\n\n\n\n\nAdapter Ligation Master Mix:\n–\n\n\nWater\n35.2 μl\n\n\n5X KAPA Ligation Buffer\n30.8μl\n\n\nKAPA T4 DNA Ligase\n11 μl\n\n\nTotal Master Mix Volume\n77 μl\n\n\nFinal reaction composition:\n–\n\n\nBeads with A-tailed DNA\n15 μl\n\n\nAdapter Ligation Master Mix\n17.5 μl\n\n\nAdapter (350 nM – 1400 nM, as appropriate)\n2.5 μl\n\n\nTotal Reaction Volume\n35 μl\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nTotal Volume Needed for 4 RXNs (10% excess)\n\n\n\n\nLibrary Ampli cation Master Mix:\n–\n\n\n2X KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix\n55 μl\n\n\n10X KAPA Library Amplication Primer Mix\n11 μl\n\n\nTotal Master Mix Volume\n66 μl\n\n\nFinal reaction composition:\n–\n\n\nAdapter-ligated library DNA\n10 μl\n\n\nLibrary Ampli cation Master Mix\n15 μl\n\n\nBalance of water (if required)\n5 μl\n\n\nTotal Reaction Volume\n30 μl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombine the following for each RNA sample to be captured:\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nVolume\n\n\n\n\nRNA sample (in RNase-free water)\n25 μl\n\n\nKAPA mRNA Capture Beads\n25 μl\n\n\nTotal Volume\n50 μl\n\n\n\n\nMix thoroughly by gently pipetting up and down several times.\nPlace the plate/tube in a thermal cycler and carry out the 1st mRNA capture program as follows:\n\n\n\n\nStep\nTemp.\nDuration\n\n\n\n\n1st mRNA capture\n65 °C\n2 min\n\n\nCool\n20 °C\n5 min\n\n\n\n\nPlace the plate/tube containing the mixture of KAPA mRNA Capture Beads and RNA on a magnet and incubate at room temperature until the solution is clear.

Kits include reagents for RNA fragmentation, 1st strand cDNA synthesis and 2nd strand synthesis/marking, and cDNA library preparation, including A-tailing, ligation and library amplification.\nSteps in Library construction (Here I just want to be explicit where we use their reagents and where we use our reagents):\n\nmRNA capture using magnetic oligo-dT beads\nFragmentation using heat and magnesium\n1st Strand cDNA Synthesis using random priming\n2nd Strand cDNA Synthesis and marking, which converts the cDNA:RNA hybrid to double-stranded cDNA (dscDNA) and incorporates dUTP in the second cDNA strand\nA-tailing to add dAMP to the 3′-ends of the dscDNA library fragments\nAdapter ligation, where dsDNA adapters with 3′-dTMP overhangs are ligated to A-tailed library insert fragments (HERE WE USE CUSTOM ADAPTERS, SEE BELOW)\nLibrary amplification to amplify library fragments carrying appropriate adapter sequences at both ends using high-fidelity, low-bias PCR; the strand marked with dUTP is not amplified.\n\n\n\n\nAnnealing buffer stock (10X):\n\n\n\nComponent\nConcentration\n\n\n\n\nTris HCl, pH 8\n100 mM\n\n\nNaCl\n500 mM\n\n\nEDTA\n10 mM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJon can you add a figure here on the adapters… Illumina calls P1 P5 and P2 P7… just to avoid confusion for the eventual user of this protocol.\n\n\n\nOligo Name\nSequence\n\n\n\n\nRNA_P2.1_H3\nP*CAAGCTTAGATCGGAAGAGCGAGAACAA\n\n\nRNA_P2.1_NC\nP*CCCATGGAGATCGGAAGAGCGAGAACAA\n\n\nRNA_P2.1_SA\nP*CGTCGACAGATCGGAAGAGCGAGAACAA\n\n\nRNA_P2.1_BS\nP*CTGTACAAGATCGGAAGAGCGAGAACAA\n\n\nRNA_P2.2_H3\nGTGACTGGAGTTCACACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTTTCGAAG*T\n\n\nRNA_P2.2_NC\nGTGACTGGAGTTCACACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTGGTACCG*T\n\n\nRNA_P2.2_SA\nGTGACTGGAGTTCACACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTCAGCTGG*T\n\n\nRNA_P2.2_BS\nGTGACTGGAGTTCACACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTACATGTG*T\n\n\nRNA_P1.1_H3\nACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTAAGCTTG*T\n\n\nRNA_P1.1_NC\nACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTCCATGGG*T\n\n\nRNA_P1.1_SA\nACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTGTCGACG*T\n\n\nRNA_P1.1_BS\nACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTTGTACAG*T\n\n\nRNA_P1.2_H3\nP*CTTCGAAATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT\n\n\nRNA_P1.2_NC\nP*CGGTACCATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT\n\n\nRNA_P1.2_SA\nP*CCAGCTGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT\n\n\nRNA_P1.2_BS\nP*CACATGTATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle-stranded oligos need to be annealed with their appropriate partner before ligation.\n\nTo create Adapter P1, combine each oligo 1.1 with its complementary oligo 1.2 in a 1:1 ratio in working strength annealing buffer (final buffer concentration 1x) for a total annealed adapter concentration of 40uM (for example, if purchased oligos are resuspended to an initial concentration of 100uM, use 40ul oligo 1.1, 40ul oligo 1.2, 10ul 10x annealing buffer and 10ul nuclease-free water). Do the same for oligos 2.1 and 2.2 to create the common adapter P2.\n\n\nIn a thermocyler, incubate at 97.5°C for 2.5 minutes, and then cool at a rate of not greater than 3°C per minute until the solution reaches a temperature of 21°C. Hold at 4°C.\nPrepare final working strength concentrations of annealed adapters from this annealed stock (the appropriate working stock dilution for your experiment can be determined from our ligation molarity calculator-WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO ADD DETAILS). For convenience, it is possible to store the adapters at 4°C while in active use.\n\nProcedure: * Prepare mastermixes for 4 libraries * See tables in manual and tables below for guidelines:\n\n\n\nComponent\nTotal Volume Needed for 4 RXNs\n\n\n\n\n1st Strand Synthesis Master Mix:\n–\n\n\n1st Strand Synthesis Buffer\n22 μl\n\n\nKAPA Script\n2 μl\n\n\nTotal Master Mix Volume\n24 μl\n\n\nFinal reaction composition:\n–\n\n\n1st Strand Synthesis Master Mix\n5 μl\n\n\nFragmented, primed RNA\n10 μl\n\n\nTotal Reaction Volume\n15 μl\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nTotal Volume Needed for 4 RXNs\n\n\n\n\n2nd Strand Synthesis and Marking Master Mix:\n–\n\n\n2nd Strand Marking Buffer\n62 μl\n\n\n2nd Strand Synthesis Enzyme Mix\n4 μl\n\n\nTotal Master Mix Volume\n66 μl\n\n\nFinal reaction composition:\n–\n\n\n2nd Strand Synthesis and Marking Master Mix\n15 μl\n\n\nFragmented, primed RNA\n15 μl\n\n\nTotal Reaction Volume\n30 μl\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nTotal Volume Needed for 4 RXNs (10% excess)\n\n\n\n\nA-Tailing Master Mix:\n–\n\n\nWater\n52.8 μl\n\n\n10X KAPA A-Tailing Buffer\n6.6 μl\n\n\nKAPA A-Tailing Enzyme\n6.6 μl\n\n\nTotal Master Mix Volume\n66 μl\n\n\nResuspend beads in a volume of:\n** 15 μl**\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nTotal Volume Needed for 4 RXNs\n\n\n\n\nAdapter Ligation Master Mix:\n–\n\n\nWater\n35.2 μl\n\n\n5X KAPA Ligation Buffer\n30.8μl\n\n\nKAPA T4 DNA Ligase\n11 μl\n\n\nTotal Master Mix Volume\n77 μl\n\n\nFinal reaction composition:\n–\n\n\nBeads with A-tailed DNA\n15 μl\n\n\nAdapter Ligation Master Mix\n17.5 μl\n\n\nAdapter (350 nM – 1400 nM, as appropriate)\n2.5 μl\n\n\nTotal Reaction Volume\n35 μl\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nTotal Volume Needed for 4 RXNs (10% excess)\n\n\n\n\nLibrary Ampli cation Master Mix:\n–\n\n\n2X KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix\n55 μl\n\n\n10X KAPA Library Amplication Primer Mix\n11 μl\n\n\nTotal Master Mix Volume\n66 μl\n\n\nFinal reaction composition:\n–\n\n\nAdapter-ligated library DNA\n10 μl\n\n\nLibrary Ampli cation Master Mix\n15 μl\n\n\nBalance of water (if required)\n5 μl\n\n\nTotal Reaction Volume\n30 μl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombine the following for each RNA sample to be captured:\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nVolume\n\n\n\n\nRNA sample (in RNase-free water)\n25 μl\n\n\nKAPA mRNA Capture Beads\n25 μl\n\n\nTotal Volume\n50 μl\n\n\n\n\nMix thoroughly by gently pipetting up and down several times.\nPlace the plate/tube in a thermal cycler and carry out the 1st mRNA capture program as follows:\n\n\n\n\nStep\nTemp.\nDuration\n\n\n\n\n1st mRNA capture\n65 °C\n2 min\n\n\nCool\n20 °C\n5 min\n\n\n\n\nPlace the plate/tube containing the mixture of KAPA mRNA Capture Beads and RNA on a magnet and incubate at room temperature until the solution is clear.

    "text": "Last updated by M.G.E. on 10/9/2024\nEdit this page\nThe Qubit machine is located on the post-PCR (blue tape) lab bench. Qubit boxes with assay tubes are located on the top shelp above the Mastercyclers. Working solutions are on the shelf below in Invitrogen bags. Standards are located in the small “No Animals” fridge. Qubit can run broad range (BR) or high-sensitivity (HS) assays to quantify DNA. DNA concentration outputs are typically in ng/uL.\nNote that working solutions are light sensitive, so try not to leave the caps off the stock solutions for too long, and run samples relatively quickly after making them. Close all boxes/bags when solutions are not in use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBR\nHS\n\n\n\n\nConcentration detection range\n0.2-2000 ng/uL\n0.005-120 ng/uL\n\n\nDNA mass detection range\n4-2000 ng\n0.1-120 ng\n\n\nBest accuracy\nWith higher range samples\nWith lower range samples\n\n\nIdeal use\nUnsure of DNA concentrations\nKnow low DNA concentrations\n\n\nStandard Ranges\n1: upper 80s-low 100s. 2: approx. 6000-8000\n1: upper 80s - low 100s 2: approx. 18,000 - 22,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you use the appropriate working solution for the assay you’re running (BR or HS).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I need to make working solution?!\n\n\n\nSome kits contain pre-made “working solution”. Other kits contain the working solution constituents and you must make a portion of the working solution yourself. We have both types of kits in the lab, so pay attention to the labels on the large brown bottles of the kit! If you must make working solution, the kit will contain dsDNA “Buffer” and dsDNA “Reagent”, typically an orange-red colored fluid in a small tube. If the kit contains pre-made working solution, the brown bottle will simply say “working solution” and you can skip to prepping the standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMath to calculate working solution\n\n\n\nQubit working solution is 199 uL Buffer:1 uL Reagent ratio.\nTo make the working solution, decide if you are running 2 uL or 1 uL of sample. See the sample math for a 2 uL sample below (also in M.G.E’s lab notebook, page 67). Prepare the total volume of working solution needed once.\nRemember\n\nYou must make 380 uL working solution for your two standards (190 uL per standard x 2)\nYou must make 198 uL working solution for each of your samples (in the example below, we are prepping for 18 samples to be run on the Qubit)\n\nCalculation\n\nMultiply your # of samples by 198\nAdd your sample working solution volume + 380 (for standards) to get your total working solution volume\nDivide your total working solution needed by 200, which is the ratio of 199 Buffer for every 1 uL of reagent (200 uL total).\nThis gives you the number of “batches” that you are making. It should be slightly more than your # of samples (here, we are making 19.5 “batches” for 18 samples.\nFor each batch, you need 1 uL of reagent. This is your reagent volume. So, we need 19.5 uL of reagent.\nThe remaining volume (total working solution - reagent volume) is your buffer amount. So here, we need 3,880.5 uL of buffer.\nMake sure your math checks back out to be a 199:1 ratio of buffer to reagent.\n\n\n\n\nMath to calculate working solution for a 2 uL sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQubit stores standard readings until new standards are read. The same standard readings can be used for up to a week.\n\nSet up two Qubit assay tubes in a tube rack. Label them ST1 (standard 1) and ST2 (standard 2)\nPipette 190 uL working solution into each tube.\nPipette 10 uL standard 1 (red cap tube) into ST1 tube and 10 uL standard 2 (yellow cap) into ST2 tube.\nVortex each tube for 2-3 seconds, then spin in the microcentrifuge for ~5 seconds, or until all liquid has collected at the bottom of the tube.\n\n\n\n\nNote: If samples have been frozen prior to Qubit, vortex and centrifuge all samples before pipetting. This will help ensure that the DNA is evenly distributed throughout the solution in the tube and not clumped at the bottom. This step is essential for getting accurate reads.\n\nLabel as many Qubit assay tubes as samples you are going to run, and place them in tube rack.\nDecide how much sample you want to use for the assay. You can use anywhere from 1-20 uL sample. We typically use 1 or 2 uL sample.\nPipette chosen amount of sample into each tube. Use the P2.5 pipette if sample volume is under 2.5 uL for more accurate measurements.\nPipette enough working solution into each tube to bring the total volume per tube to 200 uL. Ex. 1 uL sample + 199 uL working solution. Again, make sure you’re using the correct working solution for the assay you’re running.\n\nNote: As you’re pipetting samples and working solution, check the amount of volume pulled up by the pipette. Make sure this volume looks consistent with each pull.\n\nVortex each tube for 2-3 sec, then spin in the microcentrifuge for ~5 seconds, or until all liquid has collected at the bottom of the tube.\nIncubate samples for 2 min at room temperature.\nRun samples in Qubit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTap the Qubit screen to wake it up. Select dsDNA, then the assay you’re running. If a protocol comes up when the machine wakes up, just hit home until you get to the protocol selection page.\nIf running standards, select “Run standards.” Qubit will prompt you to insert Standard 1 and then Standard 2 tubes into the tube slot.\nCheck to make sure the standard reads look correct\n\nIf standards look incorrect, troubleshoot by allowing standards to sit on the benchtop for 5 minutes. Then re-read each as a “sample” under their set of standard readings.\nStandard 1 should be “out of range” - aka 0. Standard 2 should be 10 ng/ul. This is because the standards are set to be 0 and 10 ng/ul. If the values vary, re-make your standards, be sure to vortex and centrifuge them before starting again.\n\nIf standards look correct, select “Run samples”\nSet the amount of sample in uL you’re using for the read.\nQubit will prompt you on when to insert and read tubes.\nRecord sample concentrations.\nIf you need to access your data again later, go to the home page, select “Data”, then select the run whose data you want to view.\nMake sure to place a tube back into the tube slot and close the lid on the machine when finished.\n\nNote: You can only read the same sample tube once because of the sensitivity of the working solution. This is not an issue if you are double-checking your standards to ensure that they read as 0 ng/ul & 10 ng/ul.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem\nPossible solutions\n\n\n\n\nMy standard readings are weird.\nMake sure you used the right working solution and that you selected the right assay on the Qubit machine.\n\n\n“Too low: samples out of range”\nMake sure you vortexed and spun the Qubit tubes prior to reading, or the DNA may be on the side of the tube. Sample may also be at too low concentration to read.\n\n\nQubit numbers inconsistent for the same sample across reads.\nCheck that your pipette tips are pulling up the same amount of sample each time. Be sure to vortex and spin samples prior to pipetting any into the Qubit tubes.\n\n\nNumbers look generally strange.\nThe working solution is light sensitive, so don’t wait too long to read your samples. Don’t read any sample tube twice, as it can only be accurately read once.",

    "text": "4. Bisulfite PCR\nKAPA HiFi HotStart is a novel B-family DNA polymerase, engineered to have increased affinity for DNA, without the need for accessory proteins or DNA-binding domains. The intrinsic high processivity of the enzyme results in significant improvement in yield, speed and sensitivity when compared with wild-type B-family DNA polymerases and polymerase blends. When used for the amplification of next-generation sequencing (NGS) libraries, KAPA HiFi HotStart DNA Polymerase exhibits high yields with minimal amplification bias and provides extremely uniform sequence coverage.\nThe read-ahead function of proofreading DNA polymerases detects pro-mutagenic uracil residues in the template strand and prevents further strand extension, thereby reducing or completely inhibiting PCR amplification. In KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ DNA Polymerase, this uracilbinding pocket is inactivated to enable the amplification of uracil-containing DNA. The enzyme shows the same high yield, low GC-bias and coverage uniformity as the unmodified KAPA HiFi HotStart DNA Polymerase, making it particularly advantageous for applications employing bisulfite DNA conversion, which typically produces low concentrations of AT-rich DNA.\nKAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ DNA Polymerase has 5’g3’ polymerase and 3’g5’ exonuclease (proofreading) activity, but no 5’g3’ exonuclease activity. The strong 3’g5’ exonuclease activity results in superior accuracy during DNA amplification. A proprietary antibody inactivates the polymerase until the first cycle of denaturation, minimizing spurious amplification products that may result from nonspecific priming events during reaction setup and initiation, and increasing overall reaction efficiency. KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ ReadyMix (2X) is a ready-touse cocktail containing all components required for PCR, except primers and template. The ReadyMix contains 0.2 mM of each dNTP (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP), and does not contain dUTP."

Notes and troubleshooting\n\nAmplification of bisulfite-converted DNA\nAmplification of bisulfite-treated DNA can be problematic due to DNA damage arising from the harsh conditions required for near-complete conversion of unmethylated cytosines. Conversion conditions should be optimized to minimize the extent of DNA damage while ensuring sufficient conversion efficiency. Because bisulfite treatment converts cytosines to uracils, which are subsequently substituted with thymines during PCR, bisulfite-converted DNA is typically much more AT-rich than the original source DNA. This should be considered carefully when designing PCR primers, and cycling parameters such as annealing temperature may require special attention.\n\n\nMgCl2 concentration\nKAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ ReadyMix contains a final (1X) MgCl2 concentration of 2.5 mM, which is sufficient for most applications. Applications which are likely to require higher MgCl2 concentrations include long PCR (&gt;10 kb) and AT-rich PCR, as well as amplification using primers with a low GC content (&lt;40%). Note that bisulfiteconverted DNA is typically very AT-rich, as are the primers used for amplification of these templates; this application may therefore require additional MgCl2.\n\n\nPrevention of amplicon contamination with UDG\nFor effective removal of carryover contamination, dUTP must be added routinely to PCR reactions with KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ ReadyMix. Typically, dUTP is added to a concentration of 0.2 mM, but short AT-poor amplicons may require up to 0.3 mM dUTP for effective removal using UDG. For amplicons &gt;600 bp, a lower dUTP concentration (≤ 0.1 mM) may be required for efficient amplification. Low amplification efficiencies may result from incomplete UDG inactivation, in which case a longer initial denaturation may be required to inactivate the UDG prior to cycling. Refer to the manufacturer’s recommendations for optimal UDG concentration, and incubation/inactivation conditions.\n\n\nDenaturation\nDue to the high salt concentration of the KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ ReadyMix, it is important to use appropriate denaturation parameters. An initial denaturation time of 2–5 min at 95°C is recommended to ensure that complex template DNA is fully denatured before the first primer annealing step. Use 5 min for complex, genomic DNA and/ or GC-rich targets, and at least 45 sec for less complex templates such as purified viral or plasmid DNA.\n\n\nAnnealing temperature\nDue to the high salt concentration of the KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ ReadyMix, the optimal annealing temperature for a given primer set is usually different when compared with other PCR buffer systems. When using the kit with a specific primer pair for the first time, determine the optimal annealing temperature with annealing temperature gradient PCR. We recommend a gradient from 60–72°C, although some assays may require even higher annealing temperatures. For assays with optimal annealing temperatures of 68°C or higher, 2-step cycling may be performed at the optimal annealing temperature. Optimal annealing temperatures below 60°C are typically rare, but may be necessary when using primers with a high AT content, as is often the case with amplification of bisulfite-converted DNA. If a gradient PCR is not feasible, use an annealing temperature of 60°C as a first approach, and adjust the annealing temperature based on the results obtained: • If a low yield of only the specific product is obtained, lower the annealing temperature in 1–2°C increments. • If nonspecific products are formed in addition to the specific product, increase the annealing temperature in 1–2°C increments. • If no product is formed (specific or nonspecific), reduce the annealing temperature by 5°C. MgCl2 concentration may have to be increased. If only nonspecific products are formed (in a ladder-like pattern), increase the annealing temperature by 5°C.\n\n\nAmplicon length\nKAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ ReadyMix can amplify targets up to 18 kb in length from simple purified template such as plasmid DNA, and up to 15 kb in length from high quality (i.e. not bisulfite-treated), complex genomic DNA. For efficient amplification of fragments ≥10 kb, higher template concentrations, and optimization of the Mg2+ concentration, may be required.\n\n\nPrimer and template DNA quality\nPrimers should be designed to minimize the possibility of primer-dimer formation, self-priming, or nonspecific priming. Primer pairs should have similar theoretical melting temperatures (Tm), and should have a GC content of 40–60%, although this may not be feasible for bisulfite-converted template DNA. Primers with a GC content 60% may require higher denaturation temperatures or longer denaturation times, while primers with a GC content 40% may require lower annealing temperatures and increased MgCl2 concentrations. Template DNA quality has a significant impact on the success of PCR amplification. Degraded, damaged, or sheared template DNA is usually problematic. While KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ ReadyMix tolerates uracil, deamination of dCMP to dUMP in the DNA template will generate G/C to A/T mutations during amplification. NOTE: Always dilute and store primers and DNA in a buffered solution (e.g. 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 – 8.5) instead of PCR-grade water, and minimize freeze-thaw cycles to limit degradation and maintain primer quality.\n\n\nCycle number\nExcessive library amplification should be avoided to minimize the following adverse effects: • increased duplicate reads • uneven coverage depth and sequence dropout • chimeric library inserts • nucleotide substitutions • heteroduplex formation To minimize over-amplification and associated unwanted artifacts, the number of amplification cycles should be optimized to ensure a sufficient amount of amplified library for the next step in the workflow (capture or sequencing), plus the amount needed for library QC and/or archiving. Depending on the sequencing application and degree of multiplexing, 100 ng – 1.5 μg of amplified library is typically required. The number of cycles typically required will vary, depending on input amount and quality. Size selection of libraries at any part in the library construction process results in significant loss of material and as a result, 2–4 additional cycles are required for workflows which include a sizeselection step prior to library amplification.\n\n\nPrimer depletion and library over-amplification\nIn library amplification reactions (set up according to the recommended protocol), primers are typically depleted before dNTPs. When DNA synthesis can no longer take place due to primer depletion, subsequent rounds of DNA denaturation and annealing result in the separation of complementary DNA strands, followed by imperfect annealing to non-complementary partners. This presumably results in the formation of so-called “daisychains” or tangled knots, comprising large assemblies of improperly annealed, partially double-stranded, heteroduplex DNA. These species migrate slower and are observed as secondary, higher molecular weight peaks during the electrophoretic analysis of amplified libraries. However, they are typically comprised of library molecules of the desired length, which are separated during denaturation prior to target enrichment (capture) or cluster amplification. Since these heteroduplexes contain significant portions of single-stranded DNA, over-amplification leads to the under-quantification of library molecules with assays employing dsDNA-binding dyes. qPCR-based library quantification methods, such as that employed by the KAPA Library Quantification Kit, quantify DNA by denaturation and amplification, thereby providing a more accurate measurement of the amount of adapter-ligated molecules—even if the library was over-amplified."

    "text": "Setting Seeds for Reproducibility\nEdit this page\n\nAny time you call a random varible or random sample (e.g. rnorm or sample in R), your code will not be reproductible unless you set a seed. sets the starting number used to generate a sequence of random numbers – it ensures that you get the same result if you start with that same seed each time you run the same process.\nThe function set.seed can make your code reproducible, but you have to call it on the line before you ask R to do anything random.\nTry:\nset.seed(98234)\nrnorm(100)\nset.seed(98234)\nrnorm(100)\nAnd compare it to:\nset.seed(98234)\nrnorm(100)\nrnorm(100)\nIf you are running a large number of replicate simulations, it’s important to make them reproducible. A good practice is to think about what parameters you are going to model and make a giant table. Here is an example for a simulation with three replicates of two different sets of parameters:\n\n\n\nSeed\nRep\nParam 1\nParam 2\n\n\n\n\n98234\n1\n0.5\n1.2\n\n\n98235\n2\n0.5\n1.2\n\n\n98236\n3\n0.5\n1.2\n\n\n98237\n1\n0.9\n1.5\n\n\n98238\n2\n0.9\n1.5\n\n\n98239\n3\n0.9\n1.5\n\n\n\nAs you loop through this table, you can use the Seed as the mySeed for your simulations. However, there are bad and good ways to take the seed from this table and incorporate it into your simulations.\n\nBad Practice:\nset.seed(mySeed)\na&lt;-rnorm(100)\nset.seed(mySeed)\nb&lt;-rnorm(100)\nset.seed(mySeed)\nc&lt;-rnorm(100)\nTry this in R. What values do you get for a, b, and c?\n\n\nGood practice:\nset.seed(mySeed)\nsim_seeds &lt;- round(runif(100)*10000000) \n  # may need more than 100 if there are more than \n  # 100 places in your sim where you set seeds\nset.seed(sim_seeds[1])\na&lt;-rnorm(100)\nset.seed(sim_seeds[2])\nb&lt;-rnorm(100)\nset.seed(sim_seeds[3])\nc&lt;-rnorm(100)",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Edit this page\n\nQuite often we will need to transfer files to/from another computer or server. We can use what’s called an “md5 hash” to confirm a successful file transfer. A hash is basically a long alphanumeric string (e.g., beec7332e06b09a262ab252544cf7b60) and is generated by running a compression algorithm on the file. Because different files will give different md5 hashes, you can confirm a successful transfer by ensuring that the md5 hashes are the same between the transferred file and the original file.\nWe recommend using GLOBUS (add link) to tranfer files. However, if you use another file tranfer mechanism, use md5sums to make sure your files transferred successfully.\nBelow, a general overview is given. Then an example of a parallel implementation for checking many files is given.\n\n\n\n\nIf md5 sums provided by the sequencing facility in a file: md5_sum.txt (on mac is md5, on unix md5sum)\nIf not do:\nmd5sum (list files) &gt; md5sum_original.txt\n\n\n\nAfter transferring files, change directory to that location (which could be on another computer/server).\nThen, create an md5sum of the transferred files:\nmd5sum (list files in new location) &gt; md5sum_new.txt\n\n\n\nCompare sorted files FILE1 and FILE2 line by line:\ncomm -3 md5sum_original.txt md5sum_new.txt\nWith no options, produce three-column output. Column one contains lines unique to FILE1, column two contains lines unique to FILE2, and column three contains lines common to both files. -1 suppress lines unique to FILE1 -2 suppress lines unique to FILE2 -3 suppress lines that appear in both files\nIf the last command produces no output, the two files are identical.\n\n\n\n\nBelow are some examples of how to deploy md5 checksums in parallel. These instructions assume you are not on a login node of Discovery (i.e., you’re able to use more than one CPU - you may need to request an interactive job).\n\n\nInstead of running each command serially (as in Step 1 above), we can put commands for multiple files into yet another file we’ll call get_hashes.sh. Here are the first three lines of get_hashes.sh:\n\n\nget_hashes.sh\n\nmd5sum file1 &gt;&gt; md5sum_original.txt\nmd5sum file2 &gt;&gt; md5sum_original.txt\nmd5sum file3 &gt;&gt; md5sum_original.txt\n\nNote that the commands use &gt;&gt;, this will append the output to the file md5sum_original.txt, as opposed to using &gt; which would overwrite the file every command/line.\nThen you can use GNU parallel and choose the number of CPUs you would like to use. For instance to use 36 CPUs:\ncat get_hashes.sh | parallel -j 36 --progress --eta\nNote: creating the file get_hashes.sh is probably quicker if you use R (or another language) to create it by looping through your files, instead of writing each command/line by hand (including copying/pasting/editing). Here is an example in python:\n\n\ncreate_get_hashes_sh_file.py\n\n# get_files is a generic script that will return a list of the files for which you want hashes\nfiles = get_files()\n\n# make a list of commands\ncommands = []\nfor file in files:\n    commands.append(f'md5sum {file} &gt;&gt; /path/to/md5sum_original.txt')\n    \n# identify where you want commands to go\nhash_file = '/path/to/get_hashes.sh'\n\n# write commands to hash_file\nwith open(hash_file, 'w') as o:\n    o.write('\\n'.join(commands))\n\n\n\n\nYou can then do the same thing in Step 1, but for the transferred files, this time putting the hashes into md5sum_new.txt.\n\n\n\nStep 3 here is the same as Step 3 above.",

These instructions assume you are not on a login node of Discovery (i.e., you’re able to use more than one CPU - you may need to request an interactive job).\n\n\nInstead of running each command serially (as in Step 1 above), we can put commands for multiple files into yet another file we’ll call get_hashes.sh. Here are the first three lines of get_hashes.sh:\n\n\nget_hashes.sh\n\nmd5sum file1 &gt;&gt; md5sum_original.txt\nmd5sum file2 &gt;&gt; md5sum_original.txt\nmd5sum file3 &gt;&gt; md5sum_original.txt\n\nNote that the commands use &gt;&gt;, this will append the output to the file md5sum_original.txt, as opposed to using &gt; which would overwrite the file every command/line.\nThen you can use GNU parallel and choose the number of CPUs you would like to use. For instance to use 36 CPUs:\ncat get_hashes.sh | parallel -j 36 --progress --eta\nNote: creating the file get_hashes.sh is probably quicker if you use R (or another language) to create it by looping through your files, instead of writing each command/line by hand (including copying/pasting/editing). Here is an example in python:\n\n\ncreate_get_hashes_sh_file.py\n\n# get_files is a generic script that will return a list of the files for which you want hashes\nfiles = get_files()\n\n# make a list of commands\ncommands = []\nfor file in files:\n    commands.append(f'md5sum {file} &gt;&gt; /path/to/md5sum_original.txt')\n    \n# identify where you want commands to go\nhash_file = '/path/to/get_hashes.sh'\n\n# write commands to hash_file\nwith open(hash_file, 'w') as o:\n    o.write('\\n'.join(commands))\n\n\n\n\nYou can then do the same thing in Step 1, but for the transferred files, this time putting the hashes into md5sum_new.txt.\n\n\n\nStep 3 here is the same as Step 3 above.",

    "text": "Edit this page\nThe Seascape Sample Extractions (SSE) app is an app designed by Katie Lotterhos through Appsheet. It helps keep track of all data relating to the oyster DNA extracted as part of the Model Validation Program experiment. The app connects to this Google sheet and all data entered in the app shows up in the sheet. As of 07/07/2023, data added to the app will show up in the sheet, but data entered into the sheet will not necessarily populate in the app.\n\n\nTo access SSE, Katie will need to send an invite to your Google account. Once you have accepted the invite, you can access the app in the following ways:\n\nBy downloading the Appsheet app to your personal device (phone, tablet, etc)\nThrough the web version on a computer\n\nYou will need to be signed into an invited Google account to use SSE. We have a lab iPad with the app downloaded and signed into that you are welcome to use.\n\n\n\nUse SSE during DNA extractions to enter the following data:\n\nExtraction dates\nLysis start and end times\nWeights of tissues before lysis\nElution buffer info\nDNA quantification data\nGel images of extracted DNA\nAdditional extraction plans for replacement samples\n\nThe image below shows your app gallery, or all the Appsheet programs you have access to. Select the Seascape Sample Extractions App.\nThe app usually opens on the “plate” page. You can switch pages by clicking the icons at the bottom. See also the menu icon and the app refresh button, which you will need to click if any updates are made to the app structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the start of an extraction, you will need to enter it as a new extraction date. Click on the plate you’re extracting DNA from on the “plates” page shown above.\nOn the next page that comes up, you’ll see a section called “Extraction_plans”, which contains the plan label for every sample being extracted in that plate. Scroll down to the “Extraction_Dates” section. Click “Add” to input a new date.\nFill in the boxes with the requested info. You won’t be able to fill in any information past “Time lysis start” on the first day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRemember to come back to this page and fill in the rest of the info as the extraction moves forward.\n\n\n\nClick save when finished. You should be taken back to the overview page of whatever plate you’re working with.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the extraction date that you want to enter tissue weights for. Scroll down to “Extraction_mg_tissues” and click “Add.”\nFill in the data as prompted. Extraction plan keys come from pre-filled dropdown lists of plans for only the plate you’re working with, so you don’t need to worry about scrolling through plans for all plates. You can find both extraction plan keys and wells by searching for them by well in the search bar.\nClick save when finished.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are entering quantification data that was obtained using a PicoGreen assay, you will first need to enter the assay standard data.\nIn the extraction date you’re entering quant data for, scroll down to “plate_standards” and click “Add.”\nEnter the standard line equation slope and intercept. Give the standard entry a descriptive label that includes the plate label and the columns of that plate that the standard represents (ex. CviMVP_PlDNA_3_cols1_6). Click save when finished.\nGo back to the page for the extraction date you want to enter quant data for. Scroll down to “DNA_quantifications” and click “Add” to enter data.\nEnter the info as prompted. If you are entering quant data from PicoGreen, make sure to select the right plate_standards_key. You can leave this entry blank if entering Qubit data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of the corr_conc_ng_uL_auto box\n\n\n\nWe have found that PicoGreen assay concentrations are on average 2 times larger than those produced by Qubit. Qubit tends to produce the same data for the same sample much more reliably than PicoGreen, so we apply a correction factor to PicoGreen concentrations to account for this. The corr_conc_ng_uL_auto box automatically divides PicoGreen concentrations from platereader_conc_ng_uL_auto by 2. This corrected concentration is what is used in data analysis going forward.\nNo correction factors are applied to Qubit concentrations, so the concentration that appears in the qubit_conc_ng_uL box is the same that will appear in the corrected box.\n\n\n\nThe quant_status box automatically populates with “Good,” “Concentrate,” or “Reextract” based on the corrected sample concentration.\nTo add info about the sample’s quality on the gel, click save on the quant page, then go back to the extraction date page. Scroll down to “gel_images” and click “Add.”\nFill in the data as prompted. For the ladder link entry, you can copy and paste previous ladder link entries from the spreadsheet if you’re still using 1kb Plus GeneRuler ladders. Click save when finished.\nGo back to the quant section and select the sample you want to include gel data for. Scroll down past the concentration data entry section until you reach the gel section. Select the gel image for that sample and its quality.\nClick save.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf for some reason a sample in the original extraction plan is unable to be extracted (not enough tissue, unable to locate sample, etc.), you will need to find a replacement sample, and create an extraction plan for it in the app.\n\n\n\n\nIn the Seascape Sample Extraction Google sheet, find the sample that needs replacing in the “plan” tab. Take note of the Label_ind, which is usually SG_####.\nSearch the plan tab for individual labels that come numerically before and after the sample needing replacing. If you want to replace sample SG_1456, search for samples SG_1454, SG_1455, SG_1457, etc. You don’t want to replace a sample with another that has already been or will be extracted. There may be extraction plans outside of those listed in the Seascape Sample Extractions sheet, so be sure to check those as well.\nOnce you find a sample that does not turn up in any existing extraction plans, open the Seascape Samples Google sheet (different from the extraction sheet). In the “tissue” tab, use Ctrl + F to search for the label_ind of the new sample. Check to make sure its location origin is the same as that of the original sample by looking at ID_SiteDate.\nEach individual should have 3 entries in the tissue tab: mantle, gonad, and gill. Look for the vial number that has the gill of the selected individual.\nNow you’re ready to enter the new replacement sample in the app\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the plate page, click the + symbol to add a new plate. Name it as the name of the plate the replacement sample is for and “replace.”\n\nEx. CviMVP_PlDNA_4_Replace\n\nClick on the replacement plate and under “extraction_plans,” click Add.\nFollow the prompts to enter the data needed to make a new extraction plan for the replacement sample. The majority of this info can be found in the “tissue” tab in the Seascape Samples datasheet. You will need to look at the “date” tab to find the SiteDate_key. Click save when finished.\nYou can add as many replacements as you need for any given plate. We (Nicole and Kiran) and have found that if you are extracting several replacements at the same time, it’s easiest to create one extraction date for all of them and proceed as you normally would with data entry for a plate extraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t Delete Original Samples\n\n\n\nYou do not need to delete original samples from the extraction plan sheet or from past data if you replace it with a new one. It’s important to keep a record of when we replaced samples and what we replaced them with, and keeping everything in the data like this lets us have that track record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf certain samples do not have a high enough DNA concentration or have poor gel quality, you will need to re-extract them using the Qiagen individual extraction kit.\nWhen doing re-extractions, go into the plate that the samples are part of. Make a new extraction date for each single re-extraction you’re doing. For example, if you need to re-extract samples B4 and G6 from plate 4 on August 5, 2023, you would make 2 new extraction dates labeled:\n\nCviMVP_PlDNA_4_20230805_B4\nCviMVP_PlDNA_4_20230805_G6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacements vs. Re-extractions\n\n\n\nUnlike with replacement samples, you do not need to make a whole new plate for re-extractions, nor do you need to create new extraction plans for re-extractions.\n\n\n\nOnce you create the new extraction dates, you can continue entering data into the app as you normally would for any other extraction. In this case, each re-extraction replacement date will only include one sample.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce all extractions and re-extractions have been completed for a plate and all the samples are marked as “Final,” you can use the quant table in the app and spreadsheet to help when transferring DNA to your final plate.\nFor each well, the spreadsheet will automatically calculate the volume of DNA needed to get 400ng of DNA into your final plate. This calculation is done based on the corr_conc_ng_ul_auto column (DNA concentration). Transfer this volume into your final plate well.\nThe spreadsheet will also calculate the volume of molecular grade water needed for each well in the final plate to reach a total volume of 30ul. Add this volume to your final plate as well.",

    "text": "Edit this page\nNotes on how to access and use the defiance cluster\n\n\n\nTo use the defiance cluster you need to contact Stefan (graduate student in Vollmer lab; S.Kaluziak@northeastern.edu) and request access\nYou’ll need to send Stefan your public key. Public keys can be created following the steps here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/creating-ssh-keys-776639788.html And is described in\n\nAsk Stefan to give you access to /shared_lab directory\nStefan has pre-installed a lot of packages on compliance. Click here for a complete list, including version numbers.\nIf you require additional programs while using cluster, you’ll need to ask Stefan to install it. E-mail him the software and version, and he should have it installed within 24 hours.\n\n\n\nDefiance is set up with a main node (where you log in) and compute nodes Not all files/folder map perfectly across the main node and compute nodes Each user has their own remote repository that is private\n\n\n\nAfter Gaining Access from Stefan Log onto cluster by opening Terminal and typing: ssh username@defiance.neu.edu (e.g. ssh br.ford@defiance.neu.edu) You’ll then log onto a computing node. The basic outline of computing nodes is below:\ncomp5 (Lotterhos) comp6 comp7 (Bowen) comp8\nLog onto comp5 by typing: ssh comp5\nYou can only access the /shared_lab directory by logging on to one of the computing nodes (comp5)\nTo transfer files from your computer to a defiance remote directory: First, go to the folder on your computer with the file in it. Then transfer the file(s) into a remote folder my_laptop\\$ scp ./my_file br.ford@defiance.neu.edu:/home/br.ford/br.ford_remote/my_folder\nOr to download to your personal computer from defiance, go to the folder on your computer where you want the file, then: my_laptop\\$ scp br.ford@defiance.neu.edu:/home/br.ford/br.ford_remote/my_folder/my_file .\nTo download the file to a different directory than the one you are currently in, simply replace the ‘.’ at the end of the command with the path to that directory.\n/shared_lab cannot be accessed with scp, so you’ll need to move (mv) things to your remote repository before downloading to your personal computer\n\n\n\nDefiance is a shared resource, so it is important to monitor the resources being used in order to avoid overloading the server. Before beginning any resource-intensive analysis, you should log into comp5 and enter the command htop to bring up the following interface:\nhtop example\nOne way to immediately get a sense of whether too many resources are being used is to look at the load average, circled in red in this image. These 3 numbers represent the CPU load over the past minute, 5 minutes, and 15 minutes (from left to right). The higher the load average and the longer it has been high, the more concerned you should be. A spike in the load average for the past minute may be ok, but a sustained high load for the past 15 minutes means some processes need to be killed before the server crashes. How high is too high? A common rule of thumb is 0.70 x total number of CPUs. Since we have 72 CPUs on comp5, if you see the load above or approaching 50.0 you should wait for other jobs to finish before starting any new ones.\nThere is also a lot more information htop gives you that you can take into account. The top portion of the screen shows a real-time representation of how much load is on each of the 72 CPUs. In this image you can see that 2.0% of the total capacity of CPU number 38 is being used and none of the others are in use. Directly below the CPU grid is a bar showing the memory usage. 2.92 of 252 GB of memory is being used in this image. The bottom half of the htop display shows a list of processes currently running, the user they belong to, and information about the resources they are using.\nIf you want to check on your jobs only, you can use htop -u followed by your username (ex: htop -u freeman.k) to show only jobs started by your username. This can be useful to check how long your jobs have been running, to make sure they still are running and haven’t been terminated, or to see how much of the server’s capacity you are using.\nIf you would like to run a resource-intensive job without slowing down other jobs on the server, you can use the command nice when you start the job. nice -n 19 &lt;your_program&gt; will start your program with a “niceness” value of 19, meaning it will defer to all other processes when competing for CPU resources. The default niceness value is 0, 19 gives the lowest priority, and -20 gives the highest priority. Only the root user can run processes with negative niceness values.",

Generally we like to leave a few available, so can parallelize code across up to 68 cores at once.\nFor genomics, we’re often doing tests for many loci. Depending on the test, it may be faster to run each locus in serial on a core, and spread out different parts of the data across several cores (as opposed to running each locus in serial across all cores in parallel).\nTo accomplish this, you will need a bash script and an R script. Examples are below.\nThe bash script takes in the total number of tests you want to do (number of loci or number of rows in a data frame, for instance), and then calculates how many should be run in serial on each core. It then runs through a loop. In each iteration of the loop (the total number of iterations should be equal to the number of cores), the bash script calls the R code and sends information about which rows in the dataframe are to be run in the R code. Each iteration of the loop calls R in the background on a different core.\nWithin the R code, another loop would be necessary to conduct the test for each row in the dataframe (not shown).\n\n\nSave this script as runRscripts.sh\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\nset -u\nset -o pipefail\n\n\n## Use these two lines of code if you have a conda environmnent you'd like to activate\n## and list what's in that environment\n# source activate msprime-env\n# conda list\n\nmypath=\"/XXX\" # set your path\n\ncd $mypath\n\nnrows=280000 # number of loci or rows to be tested.

    "text": "Edit this page\nThe protocol for checking quantification of DNA using the PicoGreen Assay on the Synergy HTX Plate Reader.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant: PicoGreen vs. Quibit\n\n\n\nAlthough the PicoGreen and Qubit both use flourescence to quantify DNA, in our experience the amounts reported by PicoGreen are about twice the amounts reported by Qubit. Therefore, we recommend dividing the Picogreen amounts by 2 and using that number in your calculations. Meeting notes\n\n\n\n\n\nPicoGreen dsDNA Quantitation Reagent is an ultra-sensitive fluorescent nucleic acid stain for quantitating double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in molecular biological procedures such as cDNA synthesis for library production and DNA fragment purification for subcloning, as well as diagnostic applications, such as quantitating DNA amplification products and primer extension assays. The most commonly used technique for measuring nucleic acid concentration is the determination of absorbance at 260 nm (A260).\n\n\n\n\nFlat bottom black Costar 96-well plate (Fisher Cat #: 07-200-627) (long drawer under microscopes)\nPCR plate, 96-well, 0.3 mL, semi-skirted (Fisher Brand, Cat#: 14230244) (shelf above post-PCR pipettes)\nTwo 15 mL Falcon tubes (box under corner of lab benches)\nTwo 0.2 mL snap cap tubes for ladder dilutions, you can use Qubit tubes (in boxes on shelf above PCR machines)\nSamples diluted to appropriate concentration to be read on the plate reader\nMaterials from Invitrogen Quant-It PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit, cat #P7589 (in No Animals fridge)\n20X TE Buffer\nPicoGreen Dye\nDNA Ladder 100 ug/mL\nMolecular grade H2O (Fisher Scientific: Water, Molecular Grade Biology, cat#: BP2819-10)\nMilliQ H20 (get this from OGL lab space)\nStyrofoam box with ice and lid\n\n\n\n\n\nSynergy HTX plate reader in shared molecular space\nLotterhos Lab centrifuge (Eppendorf, Centrifuge 5430 R)\nVortexer\nMini centrifuge\nE-Pet, 2mL tip, 25mL tip\n1000ul single channel, 2.5ul single channel, 10ul single channel, 100ul single channel, 100ul multichannel, and 10ul multichannel pipettes and tips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nPlate reader can read samples between 25 pg/mL - 1,000 ng/mL (or 0.000025 - 1 ng/uL). To be conservative we make the highest concentration for our ladder 500 ng/mL.\nSamples should be diluted to be read within this range. For example, typical quantifications for Atlantic cod DNA extractions using a spin column plate is between 10 - 200 ng/uL. Therefore, you should do a 1:10 dilution because the reaction does a 1:100 dilution in the reaction itself. This brings the final DNA concentration to 10 - 200 ng/mL which is well within the range of the assay. The steps below will explain this in more detail. See Calculating Concentrations (Section 1.1) for more info.\nPicoGreen dye is a solid when stored at 4C. Allow the dye to come to room temperature before use. Take out the kit and leave on the counter before starting protocol to ensure it becomes a liquid. You can pipette TE and samples while it is coming to room temp.\nThe first or last column of your plate needs to be saved for the ladder standards. Therefore if you are using 6 standards and 2 empty wells as recommended in this protocol, the most samples you could run on a plate is 88. To remedy this, for a full plate of 96 samples you should prepare two plates for reading. Run samples in columns 1-6 on one plate and samples 7-12 on the other plate. For the first plate, run the standards in column 12, and for the second plate, run the standards in column 1. This will account for all 96 samples between the two plates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips for pipetting\n\n\n\nSee the Pipetting Tips page for advice on good pipetting practice and troubleshooting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill a styrofoam box with ice. Place your samples on ice and keep them there the whole time they’re out of the fridge to prevent degradation.\nOnce samples have thawed, vortex and centrifuge the plate to make sure DNA is spread evenly throughout the sample. There are plates of practice DNA in the -20 freezer that you can use as a counterweight.\nDilute your DNA samples. Use the Easy-Pet with a 2mL tip to transfer 2mL of MilliQ H20 into a liquid boat. Using the P100 multichannel pipette, add 20uL of MilliQ H20 to all wells of a 96 well PCR plate. Using the P10 multichannel pipette with filtered tips, add 2uL of your DNA to the corresponding wells of the PCR plate. Keep the PCR plate of diluted samples on ice.\nSeal the PCR plate with a plastic tape sheet, vortex with the plate attachment, and centrifuge with ‘short’ setting, using a tip wafer as a counterweight. This is a 1:10 dilution as required to be read by PicoGreen.\nIf you are quantifying a full plate of samples, set up 2 black flat-bottom 96-well plates. Use the first one for your samples from columns 1-6, and put the Picogreen standards in column 12. Use the second one for your samples from columns 7-12, and add the standards to column 1. Label both plates with lab tape. If you are using two plates, you will need to create double the amounts of ladder standards.\nFind the 20X TE in the Picogreen kit. To dilute it to 1X TE, use a 25mL Easy-Pet tip to pipette 9.5 mL of Molecular Grade H2O into a 15mL Falcon tube. Using the p1000 single channel pipette and unfiltered tips, add 500ul of 20X TE to the Falcon tube. This solution is stable long term so you can make more than you will need and store for later use. For example, for two plates, you can double these quantities. If you will not be using it frequently, you can also calculate exactly how much you need and just make enough for that use.\nCreate your ladder standards using Table 1. The stock ladder is at 100 ug/mL. To make Dilution 1 at 2 ug/mL, use the P2.5 and P100 single channel pipettes to combine 1 uL of stock ladder with 49 uL of 1X TE in a 0.2 mL snap cap (Qubit) tube. Vortex and spin Dilution 1 in the mini centrifuge.\nTo make Dilution 2, use the P2.5 and P10 single channel pipettes to combine 1uL of Dilution 1 and 9uL of 1X TE in another 0.2 mL snap cap tube. Vortex and spin Dilution 2 in the mini centrifuge. Double these quantities if you are preparing two Picogreen plates for a full plate of samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLadder Type\nConcentration (ug/mL)\nLadder Type\nLadder Vol (uL)\n1X TE Vol (uL)\n\n\n\n\nD1\n2\nStock\n1\n49\n\n\nD2\n0.2\nD1\n1\n9\n\n\n\n\nPour the 1X TE from the Falcon tube into a liquid boat. Using the P100 multichannel, pipette 49 uL of 1X TE in all sample wells. If you are using two plates, this will be columns 1-6 on one plate, and columns 7-12 on the other plate.\nUsing the correct pipette, add the appropriate volume of 1X TE into each standard well according to Table 2. For example, for standard 1, use the P100 single channel and pipette 25 uL of 1X TE in the appropriate well. If you are using two plates, make sure to prepare standards for each plate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandards\nConcentration (ng/mL)\nLadder Type\nLadder Vol (uL)\n1X TE Vol (uL)\nDiluted PicoGreen Vol (uL)\n\n\n\n\n1\n500\nD1\n25\n25\n50\n\n\n2\n250\nD1\n12.5\n37.5\n50\n\n\n3\n100\nD1\n5\n45\n50\n\n\n4\n10\nD2\n5\n45\n50\n\n\n5\n4\nD2\n2\n48\n50\n\n\nblank\n0\n-\n-\n50\n50\n\n\n\n\nDiagram of volumes of ladders and 1X TE required for each plate standard \nThe sample wells are prepared according to Table 3.

You do not need to add anything to unused wells.\nYour PicoGreen should be at room temperature, but if it’s not, hold it in your hand to help it liquify. To create your diluted PicoGreen, use Equation 1 to determine how much stock PicoGreen dye you need for the number of samples/standards you are running. Then use that value to calculate the amount of 1X TE this should be added to for a 200 times dilution using Equation 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculates the volume of undiluted stock PicoGreen needed to make diluted PicoGreen for a given number of standards and samples.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1.1 * 50 \\mu L \\textrm{ diluted PicoGreen * (Num. samples + Num. standards)}}{200} = \\textrm{vol PicoGreen Stock needed} \\tag{1}\\]\n\n\n\n\nCalculates the volume of 1X TE needed to dilute the stock PicoGreen.\n\n\\[ 199 * \\textrm{vol of Stock PicoGreen} = \\textrm{vol of 1x TE} \\tag{2}\\]\n\nPipette 50ul of the diluted PicoGreen into each well. When adding the diluted PicoGreen, pipette up and down at least 20 times to mix sample, 1X TE and PicoGreen together. To keep track of which columns you added PicoGreen to, you can write down the column labels and cross them out as you go.\nCover the plate with a plastic tape sheet and briefly spin down the plate to get all liquid to the bottom of the well. Use the Lotterhos lab centrifuge and a pipette tip wafer as a counterweight. Spin both plates together if you have two.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst switch on the plate reader to warm up (takes ~2-3 minutes).\n\n\n\nUsing the laptop next to the reader, open Gen5 software. On the opening window make sure you are in the “Run Now” option on the left side column and click on the PicoGreen Assay full plate file.\n\n\n\n\nThis will open another window with a full plate already loaded. Click “cancel.”\n\n\n\nClick the “Plate Layout” symbol on the top bar. It looks like a little plate with a red circle over one of the wells. This will open a new window with a 96 well plate. You can then specify where your standards, blanks, empty wells, and standard wells are.\n\n\n\nClear plate by highlighting “EMPTY” on the left panel and click and drag across whole plate.\n\n\n\nClick the first standard curve value in the left panel and click on the well where that standard is located. You can click and drag down the column to fill in remaining standards if they are in numeric order.\n\n\n\nHighlight the first sample (SP1) from the left panel and click on the well with your first sample well and drag across the plate until all wells you want readings for are filled. You don’t need to put in any information for empty wells.\n\n\n\nWhen this is done click “okay”. The machine will have a bulb warm up period after which it will ask you to load your plate. You do not need to close the drawer it will close automatically after you load the plate and click “okay”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlate Orientation\n\n\n\nMake sure the plate is loaded with well A1 in the top left. There’s a marker for A1 in the top left corner of the plate reader tray to indicate how to orient the plate. You can only run a plate through the reader once, so make sure you run it properly.\n\n\n\nThe run should take 2-3 minutes. Once complete, click on the “Statistics” tab and output that spreadsheet to an excel file or Google sheet by copying to clipboard and pasting.\n\n\n\n\nFinally use the spreadsheet to convert absorbance values to associated concentrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting RFU to ng/uL\n\n\n\nThe plate reader outputs concentrations in RFU (relative fluorescence units). You will need to convert these values first to ng/mL, then to ng/uL using the following steps. Keep in mind that the concentrations determined by the PicoGreen are for the 1000X diluted DNA that was created for the assay. This DNA has the unit ng/mL. To find the concentration of the undiluted sample, you will need to multiply your PicoGreen concentration by 1000. Then, to convert from ng/mL to ng/uL, divide by 1000 (1 mL = 1000 uL). Hence, the 1000s cancel out and the value of the concentration of the diluted samples in ng/mL is the same as the value of the concentration of the undiluted samples in ng/uL, so no math is really necessary. See image below for math. \n\n\n\nPlot your standards in a scatter plot with concentration in ng/mL on the x axis and RFU on the y axis. If doing this in Google Sheets, go to “Series” in the chart editor, and add a linear trendline to the graph. Label the line with the line equation. Check the box next to R^2 to show the R^2 value on the graph. You will use the equation of this line to convert the RFU values for your samples to concentration in ng/mL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR^2 Values\n\n\n\nThe R^2 value describes how well a set of data points fit a particular trendline. A value of 1 indicates a perfect fit, while a value of 0 indicates no fit between points and the line, meaning the line is a poor description of the data. If your R^2 value for the standards is below 0.99, you should redo your PicoGreen assay.\n\n\nExample of a Good Standard Plot (R=1) \n**Example of a Bad Standard Plot (R=0.86)\n\n\n\nRFU vs Concentration (ng_uL)\n\n\n\nIf your standard curve has an R^2 value of less than 0.99 as in the example above, redo the PicoGreen assay.\n\n\nRearrange the equation of the standards line to solve for x. In this case, x is your concentration in ng/mL and y is your RFU value, which the plate reader determined.\nMake a new column in your datasheet for concentrations and use the equation above to solve for concentration based on the RFU values. You can copy this equation down the datasheet to avoid having to retype it after writing it the first time.\nAs described above, the resulting concentration is in ng/mL and describes the concentration of the 1000X diluted DNA samples that were used in the PicoGreen assay. In converting from diluted to undiluted DNA and from ng/mL to ng/uL, the conversions cancel out, so the concentrations calculated in this step represent a) the concentration of the diluted DNA in ng/mL and b) the concentration of the undiluted DNA in ng/uL. Describe all original, undiluted DNA concentrations in ng/uL.\nYou may choose to divide sample concentrations by 2 to make up for the 2x difference between PicoGreen and Qubit concentrations sample. This value represents the final concentration of your undiluted samples in ng/uL.\nRecord sample concentrations in the datasheet or app.",

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\n\nPlate reader can read samples between 25 pg/mL - 1,000 ng/mL (or 0.000025 - 1 ng/uL). To be conservative we make the highest concentration for our ladder 500 ng/mL.\nSamples should be diluted to be read within this range. For example, typical quantifications for Atlantic cod DNA extractions using a spin column plate is between 10 - 200 ng/uL. Therefore, you should do a 1:10 dilution because the reaction does a 1:100 dilution in the reaction itself. This brings the final DNA concentration to 10 - 200 ng/mL which is well within the range of the assay. The steps below will explain this in more detail. See Calculating Concentrations (Section 1.1) for more info.\nPicoGreen dye is a solid when stored at 4C. Allow the dye to come to room temperature before use. Take out the kit and leave on the counter before starting protocol to ensure it becomes a liquid. You can pipette TE and samples while it is coming to room temp.\nThe first or last column of your plate needs to be saved for the ladder standards. Therefore if you are using 6 standards and 2 empty wells as recommended in this protocol, the most samples you could run on a plate is 88. To remedy this, for a full plate of 96 samples you should prepare two plates for reading. Run samples in columns 1-6 on one plate and samples 7-12 on the other plate. For the first plate, run the standards in column 12, and for the second plate, run the standards in column 1. This will account for all 96 samples between the two plates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips for pipetting\n\n\n\nSee the Pipetting Tips page for advice on good pipetting practice and troubleshooting.",

    "text": "Fill a styrofoam box with ice. Place your samples on ice and keep them there the whole time they’re out of the fridge to prevent degradation.\nOnce samples have thawed, vortex and centrifuge the plate to make sure DNA is spread evenly throughout the sample. There are plates of practice DNA in the -20 freezer that you can use as a counterweight.\nDilute your DNA samples. Use the Easy-Pet with a 2mL tip to transfer 2mL of MilliQ H20 into a liquid boat. Using the P100 multichannel pipette, add 20uL of MilliQ H20 to all wells of a 96 well PCR plate. Using the P10 multichannel pipette with filtered tips, add 2uL of your DNA to the corresponding wells of the PCR plate. Keep the PCR plate of diluted samples on ice.\nSeal the PCR plate with a plastic tape sheet, vortex with the plate attachment, and centrifuge with ‘short’ setting, using a tip wafer as a counterweight. This is a 1:10 dilution as required to be read by PicoGreen.\nIf you are quantifying a full plate of samples, set up 2 black flat-bottom 96-well plates. Use the first one for your samples from columns 1-6, and put the Picogreen standards in column 12. Use the second one for your samples from columns 7-12, and add the standards to column 1. Label both plates with lab tape. If you are using two plates, you will need to create double the amounts of ladder standards.\nFind the 20X TE in the Picogreen kit. To dilute it to 1X TE, use a 25mL Easy-Pet tip to pipette 9.5 mL of Molecular Grade H2O into a 15mL Falcon tube. Using the p1000 single channel pipette and unfiltered tips, add 500ul of 20X TE to the Falcon tube. This solution is stable long term so you can make more than you will need and store for later use. For example, for two plates, you can double these quantities. If you will not be using it frequently, you can also calculate exactly how much you need and just make enough for that use.\nCreate your ladder standards using Table 1. The stock ladder is at 100 ug/mL. To make Dilution 1 at 2 ug/mL, use the P2.5 and P100 single channel pipettes to combine 1 uL of stock ladder with 49 uL of 1X TE in a 0.2 mL snap cap (Qubit) tube. Vortex and spin Dilution 1 in the mini centrifuge.\nTo make Dilution 2, use the P2.5 and P10 single channel pipettes to combine 1uL of Dilution 1 and 9uL of 1X TE in another 0.2 mL snap cap tube. Vortex and spin Dilution 2 in the mini centrifuge. Double these quantities if you are preparing two Picogreen plates for a full plate of samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLadder Type\nConcentration (ug/mL)\nLadder Type\nLadder Vol (uL)\n1X TE Vol (uL)\n\n\n\n\nD1\n2\nStock\n1\n49\n\n\nD2\n0.2\nD1\n1\n9\n\n\n\n\nPour the 1X TE from the Falcon tube into a liquid boat. Using the P100 multichannel, pipette 49 uL of 1X TE in all sample wells. If you are using two plates, this will be columns 1-6 on one plate, and columns 7-12 on the other plate.\nUsing the correct pipette, add the appropriate volume of 1X TE into each standard well according to Table 2. For example, for standard 1, use the P100 single channel and pipette 25 uL of 1X TE in the appropriate well.

Containers contain all the dependencies you need to run a program, so in theory they make getting started a lot easier!\nFirst, read the research computing documentation: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/containers/singularity.html\n\n\n\nYou will need read access to /work/lotterhos/Containers/\n\ncd /work/lotterhos/Containers Go to the shared folder in the Lotterhos Lab Storage on Discovery where we keep the containers ls look at the list of containers. The containers will end with an sif extension, which is a singularity image.\nAnd to run a container from anywhere type the following, but replace  with the actual name: singularity run /work/lotterhos/Containers/&lt;NAME&gt;.sif\nFor example: singularity run /work/lotterhos/Containers/lumpy_0.2.13.sif\n\n\n\n\nYou will need write access to /work/lotterhos/Containers/ on Discovery\nGo to DockerHub https://hub.docker.com\nUse the search to find the program you need a container for\n\nfor example, you could search for samtools. There are a lot of results but this one looks promising! https://hub.docker.com/r/biocontainers/samtools\ncheck the version of the program compared to the latest version. You may not be able to find out the version until you install it.\n\n\nOnce you have the path to the container, on Discovery type the following commands:\nsrun --constraint=ib -p lotterhos --pty /bin/bash This takes you to a partition to run the code. The option ib = infiniband gives faster network connection, which you may need to download larger containers.\nmodule load singularity/3.10.3 Singularity is the program that we will use to get the container from the web, download it, and run it\ncd /work/lotterhos/Containers Go to the shared folder in the Lotterhos Lab Storage on Discovery where we keep the containers\nexport SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=$(pwd)/cache set the cache directory. Singularity will cache files here when building the container.\nexport SINGULARITY_TMPDIR=$(pwd)/tmp set the tmp directory. Singularity will store tmp files here when building the container.\nsingularity pull docker://dceoy/lumpy:latest Pull the container from DockerHub. In this case, we pull the program lumpy from the user dceoy and it has the tag latest.

It doesn’t really matter if the ${PATH} is at the beginning or end. Probably just a matter of preference or convention where you decide to put it. It does need to be somewhere though to include the other paths that are stored in ${PATH}. So when you run the ENV command it is appending ${PATH} instead of overwriting path.\nFor setting channels in conda, for my personal use I prefer to not have them set to my .condarc and just specify them when I run “conda install”. This is mainly because I don’t want any channel priority in case the same package is found in multiple channels. But this may just be a personal preference.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you open Podman Desktop, make sure that you have containers.rc.northeastern.edu listed in your registries. To add it, just use the address and log in with your NU ID and password. \nThen, go to the Container Icon.  Click +Create and choose Containerfile or Dockerfile.\nIf the program proceeds normally, you should be prompted to specify the path to the Dockerfile that you just created on your laptop (first entry in figure below) and the Image Name. VERY IMPORTANT: The Image Name needs a path to our containers on research computing’s Harbor site: containers.rc.northeastern.edu/lotterhos/&lt;ImageName:tag&gt;. For example: containers.rc.northeastern.edu/lotterhos/test:3. The ImageName is a description, while the tag is the version of the container. They are seperated by a colon : and the program expects this naming system. By keeping the ImageName the same and updating the tag every time you make an edit to the container, the program can build the container faster each time from the cache for ImageName. Make sure to click Intel and AMD x86_64 because that is what you’ll need to run the container on Discovery! \nWhen it is done, you will see at the bottom of the output: Successfully built &lt;code&gt; Successfully tagged &lt;ImageName:tag&gt;\nTroubleshooting (if you are unable to create a new container) If you are having trouble creating a new container, it may be because your PodMan Machine isn’t starting because it needs more memory or space than your computer can handle. In this case you would go to Settings--&gt;Resources--&gt;Podman--&gt;Create new and select about half of the CPUs, Memory, and a small amount of disk size for your container. If you ask for too much, it will just wait forever for those resources to be allocated!\n\n\n\nNext, go to the “Images” tab. The container that you just created is at the top. You will see the &lt;ImageName&gt; with the &lt;tag&gt; below. Here is an example for the test with the tag 3 that I just created:\n\nClick the “Play” button next to the container you want to test. It will create a container. You can leave all the fields blank. Click “Start Container”. It will open the command line. Try running commands for the programs you installed.\nTo test fastqc, which is the program in the example Dockerfile above, type fastqc.\n\n\n\nRepeat Steps 1-3 until you finalize the container - edit the Dockerfile, remake the container, and create a test container from the image in Podman Desktop. It is an interative process.\n\n\n\nFrom the Image tab, click the vertical ... and select Push Image. This will push it to our Harbor site.\n\nThen you would log into Discovery and type the following:\nsrun --pty bash\nmodule load singularity/3.10.3\ncd /work/lotterhos/Containers\nexport SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=$(pwd)/cache \nexport SINGULARITY_TMPDIR=$(pwd)/tmp\nsingularity pull --docker-login docker://containers.rc.northeastern.edu/lotterhos/&lt;ImageName:version&gt;\nls when you list files, you should see the &lt;ImageName&gt;.sif in the file list In practice, it’s not a good idea to save everything with the name latest, so if necessary rename it with the mv command and give it a version.\nAnd to run it from anywhere type: singularity run /work/lotterhos/Containers/&lt;ImageName&gt;\n\n\n\n\nIn your home, scratch, or work directory create your own folder for Containers with subfolders for cache and tmp\nmkdir Containers\ncd Containers\nmkdir cache\nmkdir tmp\nThen, you basically follow all the steps above, but replace work/lotterhos/Containers with the path to this folder.\n\n\n\nWe use conda environments to load software on Discovery.\nSee this site for more information on how to load environments and update the yml files.\nIf you create a yml for your analysis, be sure to talk with Dr. L about sharing it with the group.\nShared Lotterhos Group Environments with Research Computing\n    lotterhos_R.yml\n    lotterhos_RADseq.yml\n    lotterhos_RNAseq.yml\n    lotterhos_aligners.yml\n    lotterhos_gatk.yml\n    lotterhos_methylation.yml\n    lotterhos_popgen.yml\n    lotterhos_utils.yml\n    lotterhos_variantCallers.yml\nUse conda deactivate to change conda environments\n\n\n\nWhen we first started using Discovery, we had modules set up for our research\n\nWe have a software module on Discovery for the lab’s research\nThere are some programs loaded in modules, and others loaded in conda environments. If you are working in a conda environment, it won’t detect programs loaded in the module outside that environment\nOne conda environment is lotterhos-py38, which is running python 3.8. Note that many bioinformatics programs are not updated for this environment. Slim 3.3.2 is in this environment.\nAnother conda environment is ddocent2, which is running python 3.7 and all of the ddocent dependencies\nmodule show lotterhos/2020-08-24\nmodule load lotterhos/2020-08-24\nsource activate ddocent2\nconda list\nUse the module avail command to show a list of the most currently available software on Discovery.\n\nsratoolkit/2.10.8 was added as a seperate module that was then added to your module, while ddocent-2.7.8 was added to the conda environment “lotterhos-py38” within the anaconda3/L2020-03 module\nOld module: lotterhos/2019-11-15, lotterhos/2020-03-18, lotterhos/2020-07-21\n\nIn the future we hope to work on Docker containers for loading R packages and developing containers for specific projects. A container allows you to create the same environment that you were using when you analyzed the data.\n\n\n\nPackRat environments can be great for using on OOD or Discovery\nCreate PackRat environments for R",

    "text": "Edit this page\nThese instructions will cover the following topics:\n\nConnecting to Discovery using ssh\nConnecting to Discovery using ssh without a password\nssh-ing using an alias\n\nThis tutorial assumes you are familiar with using terminal - see also instructions for installing iTerm\nBelow, if I want you to execute a terminal command, I’ll preface the command with “do” - eg “do ls”.\nTo connect to Discovery, and most servers used in academia, we can use a Secure SHell (ssh) that will allow our computer to plug in our monitor to the server. Just like our home monitors show what’s going on ‘inside’ our computer, the ssh tunnel allows us to use the server like we would use our own computer.\nI’m assuming everyone has the credentials on the IT side of things to be able to connect to discovery. Ask Katie if this is not the case.\nBefore actually getting into doing the ‘connecting’, we should cover some basic commands to navigate in terminal, where we’ll eventually execute the ssh command. If you are not familiar with basic terminal commands, see the lab protocols page here. Generally the types of ‘native’ commands used will be BASH - BAsic SHell; think of BASH like a computer language and the terminal as a session of BASH). The BASH commands from this protocol that we’ll need immediately are cd and ls . Read those sections then come back here and continue.\nThe following instructions cover connecting “Computer A” (e.g., your laptop) to “Server B” (e.g., Discovery). But if you wanted to connect to another server from Discovery, you would follow these steps for creating and editing files on Discovery - in other words, Discovery would now be “Computer A” and the new server would be “Server B”.\n\n\n\nOnce you have your discovery credentials, you should be able to ssh to discovery like this: ssh your_login@login.discovery.neu.edu. It will then prompt you for a password. You can keep entering a password every time you log in (which can get annoying, if the long login isn’t annoying enough) or we can create a file (see next step) that will tell Discovery that you’re really you and you won’t have to enter a password afterward.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we can ssh without a password, we need to create a folder on your laptop.\nOn mac and linux, the short cut to your “home” directory is ~. So if you had a folder called ‘documents’ in your home directory, you could access that file path with ~/documents. On a mac, that path is something like /Users/yourusername. You can also ask BASH to tell you your username with echo $USER. Or you can ask for the actual home path echo $HOME. If you’re using a PC, we’ll need to replace the home path ~ with the actual path - ask Katie for help if needed.\nTo connect to Discovery with ssh we’re going to need a place to put files. That place by default is in a hidden folder called .ssh in your home directory on your laptop (note the .). So let’s first change directories to the home directory on your laptop (do cd ~) and see if you have it (to do this step you should not be ssh-ed to Discovery yet). Normally to see files you would use ls but to see hidden files (those that start with .) you need to add -a to the command - let’s get the long form list of all files (do ls -la).\nIf you don’t see .ssh, make the directory - do mkdir .ssh.\nthen do cd .ssh\n\n\n\nThe file that Discovery uses to ‘trust’ us is called an RSA key (abbr is creators names Rivest–Shamir–Adleman). To create that key, make sure you ARE NOT ssh-ed to discovery (ie you are in your laptop’s filesystem in the ~/.ssh folder) and execute this command ssh-keygen -t rsa. - Executing this command should ask you to create the file id_rsa in your $HOME/.ssh folder; agree. - When it asks you for a password, just hit the return key (and again for the confirmation). In other words, don’t enter a password.\nYou should now see the id_rsa file (and maybe a couple others with that prefix) if you do ls -l.\n\n\n\nOkay, we’ve created the key for Discovery, but now we have to give that key to discovery.\nBefore we send the file, we’ll need a destination (directory) to send it to on Discovery. do ssh your_login@login.discovery.neu.edu mkdir -p .ssh - you’ll get a password prompt since we haven’t completed the setup yet. This command first logs in to Discovery then makes the hidden directory called .ssh in your Discovery home directory. In the screenshot I make a directory I’ll delete later.\nThe key Discovery will use to authenticate us is actually the content within the file called id_rsa.pub. To send this key to Discovery, we’re going to use a command called cat which basically prints the content of a file (try doing cat id_rsa.pub by itself). We’re also going to use a pipe | (on keyboard above return key; use shift) - the pipe let’s you take standardout (like something that’s printed) and pass it to another command. So we could print the rsa key and pass it to a command to send it to discovery like so: do cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh your_login@login.discovery.neu.edu 'cat &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys'. You’ll be prompted for your login password again. If it works, there won’t be any fanfare - it will just give you a new prompt for your local filesystem (it makes a connection, sends the info, then ends the connection).\nThe command prints the file contents (cat id_rsa.pub) then sends that printout to an ssh connection | ssh me@domain then after connecting uses another cat command ('cat) to send the contents of the original file on our laptop to a discovery file &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys'. The command executed after connection is surrounded by single quotes: ' . Note that we used &gt;&gt; to append to the discovery file. Had we used just &gt; it would have overwritten/created the file with just the new content. We’ll often have multiple computers that we use to ssh (eg a different server connecting to discovery) so we may have many keys in this authorized key file (which is why we append the new content with &gt;&gt;).\nYou should now be able to ssh without a password: do ssh your_login@login.discovery.neu.edu.\n\n\n\n\nIf you’ve followed the steps above you can now connect to Discovery without a password (or another server by following the same steps), but each time you want to ssh to the server you’ll still have to type out a long command: ssh user@login.yadayada.domain. If you ever want to transfer files to/from the server you’ll also need to use the long-form user/domain: eg scp localfile.txt user@login.yadayada.domain:/path/to/transfer_location.\nWith an alias, you can replace the user@login with a nickname for the server and make ssh-ing much easier: eg ssh discovery. Or for transferring files: scp localfile.txt discovery:/path/to/transfer_location.\nIn Step 2 we created the ~/.ssh directory on our laptops. We can customize the way ssh connections “work” by using a config file (ie a ‘configuration’ file). I’m not sure if you’ll have one, but try doing: ls ~/.ssh/config. If you don’t have it, we’ll be creating it using vim below.\nWe’ll be using vim to add our ssh aliases to the config file. vim is basically a terminal text editor that you can view and edit the contents of files. It is actually pretty powerful, but I only use its basic parts. If you try and vim a file that doesn’t exist, one is created and you’ll see blank content.\nSo we want to edit the config file. Using terminal that is within your laptop’s filesystem (i.e., not ssh-ed to discovery) do vim ~/.ssh/config.\nTo use vim, we use the keyboard keys instead of drop down menus. To begin editing, hit the i key (for “insert”). Paste the following at the top of the file (the normal way with command+v). The first bit will apply to all hosts (*) and do a couple other things that you can look up later (this is not the alias part).\n ``` {style=\"background-color: gainsboro\"}\n Host *\n Protocol 2\n TCPKeepAlive yes\n ServerAliveInterval 300\n ```\nTo create aliases to servers, we provide our nickname for that host, our user name for that host, and the domain for that host (the bits after the @ of our login). The following will allow me to ssh discovery without typing out the long-form user@ domain (just change the user). Note I’ve kept the text from above for context, it should only appear once in the file.\n ``` {style=\"background-color: gainsboro\"}\n Host *\n Protocol 2\n TCPKeepAlive yes\n ServerAliveInterval 300\n \n Host discovery\n User b.lind\n HostName login.discovery.neu.edu\n ```\nTo save the file, we’re going to tell vim to “write then quit”. To do this first hit the esc key, then type :wq (note colon) then hit enter. If you ever make a mistake while editing, or vim a non-existent file you don’t want to create, you tell vim to quit but ignore any warnings about quitting using an exclamation: :q! (note we wouldn’t tell vim to write to the file using w).\nYou can do this for any host. For instance here are a couple canadian servers I have configured like so:\n ``` {style=\"background-color: gainsboro\"}\n Host yeaman02\n User brandon.lind\n HostName itbioyeaman02.ucalgary.ca\n \n Host yeaman01\n User brandon.lind\n HostName itbioyeaman.ucalgary.ca\n \n Host yeaman03\n User brandon.lind\n HostName itbioyeaman03.ucalgary.ca\n ```\n \nAfter successfully saving (you can always cat ~/.ssh/config to print the file), and using the correct username, you should be able to do ssh discovery (from a non ssh-ed terminal window).\nAs a note, you can use whatever nickname you want, really. but “discovery” is probably easiest to remember. For example, if you wanted to be able to ssh hogwarts to connect to the Discovery server you could use this in your config file instead of what we used above:\n ``` {style=\"background-color: gainsboro\"}\n Host hogwarts\n User b.lind\n HostName login.discovery.neu.edu\n ```",

Pressure fluctuates with MSC-wide system use from day to day. Check that hoses are secure at the base.\nEffluent float valve - Make sure the float valve is working. It should turn on when it is lifted up, and turn off when it falls down. If the float valve does not turn on, the sump tank will overflow and flood the bunker. If the float valve does not fall all the way down it will not turn off, which will burn out the pump. If the sump pump burns out, the sump tank will overflow and flood the bunker.\nEffluent UV lights - If effluent is being treated, check that both the UV lights are working and the water is flowing in the correct direction.\nSea Table Drains - Make sure drains are clear of debris.\nEffluent - write down the pressure on the valve before the blue filter and the valve after the blue filter.\nInfluent filtered water - write down the pressure on the valve before and after the filters on the incoming water.\nHousekeeping - Make sure all lines are labeled (e.g. unfiltered seawater, filtered seawater, municipal freshwater, etc.), all lab equipment is labeled “Lotterhos”, and all equipment and tools are put out of sight (things tend to walk off).\nCheck for dead animals.\n\n\n\n\nLink to Weekly Checklist Table\n\nEffluent - Clean the sump in a bucket of freshwater. First, lift up the float valve and drain most of the salt water from the sump tank down to normal stop level. Fill a “E” bucket (be careful, some buckets have had chemicals and not for placement in sump) with freshwater. Unplug the sump pump, and carefully place it in the bucket. Plug it back in, and use the float valve to turn it on and hold it up until the pump runs through the bucket of freshwater. Then unplug the pump again, place it back in the tank, and plug it in. Test the float valve again as described in “Daily checklist: Effluent float valve.”\nEffluent - inspect sump pump hose for cracks, especially around where the hose clamps are. Make sure the hose clamps are tight.\n\n\n\n\nLink to Monthly Table\n\nUse the shop vac to clean out the debris at the bottom of the sump.\nCheck for leaks along the main lines to the sea tables.\nCheck for leaks along the the freshwater line.\nCheck for leaks along the bottom pipe that runs below the sea tables to the sump pump\nCheck for leaks when the sump pump is running between the sump and the drainage pipe.\nAll motors (fans, pumps, etc), solenoids, and relays are inductive in nature. Do not plug these into power strips, plug them directly into the red receptacles. Check monthly.\nCheck the plugs for corrosion. Scrub with green abrasive pad.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfiltered seawater has a central connection to a PVC pipe that runs across all the tables.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltered seawater is connected on the left side of the tables and currently only runs to the first table.\n\n\n\n\n\nTO DO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee MSC Best Practices Document. Usually we treat effluent for any animals not collected from Nahant or the Massachusetts Bay area.\nMake sure that the valve to the filters is open and the other valve is closed.\nMake sure that both UV lights are turned ON.\n\n\n\n\nChanging the filter in the blue housing. Turn off the flow to the seatables, unplug the pump and UV lights. Close the valves. Open the housing and remove the filter. There is a replacement filter behind the blue housing. Grease the O-ring on the housing with silicon grease and change the filter. Set all the valves correctly, plug everything back in and turn everything back on. Check to make sure float valve is working, check for leaks in pipes and around filter housing.\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that the valve to the filters is closed and the other valve is open.\nMake sure the UV lights are unplugged.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the instructions!\n \n\n\nIf you see water in the quartz sleeve, this means it was not put together correctly and it leaked.\n\nAlso look for signs that the bulb is burning out by the black residue inside the quartz tube:\n\nIf the light is blue does that mean the UV light is working? Read the instructions to find the answer to this question. The answer will surprise you.\n\n\n\nMake sure when you change the bulb, to follow the instructions and use silicone grease. It can be found in a plastic box with a white top labeled “hot glue, silicone grease, etc.”\n\nOn the gasket (which should be changed once a year), make sure to put some silicone grease on the inside and smoosh it around with your finger:\n\nMake sure to follow these instructions as you put it back together:\n\nThis is wrong:\n\nMake sure when you put it back together, screw in the coupling tight before attaching it to the housing:\n\nIt’s hard to see, but check that the gasket is securely in place:\n\nWhen you put the wires in, make sure not to let them get twisted by carefully stuffing them inside,\n\nThen holding the top wire taught (don’t let it twist) while you screw the top on:\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace bulbs.

    "title": "Collecting Samples for DNA",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Edit this page\nProtocols and tips for collecting samples for DNA extraction\n\n\n\nWith next generation sequencing, it is important to consider all possible sources of contamination when collecting samples. It is also important to consider downstream analysis that may be affected by the method of preservation for collected samples. For example, best results for DNA extraction will come from flash-frozen DNA. For whole genome sequencing, DNA methylation and bisulfite sequencing, flash-frozen DNA is also the preferred collection method, but DNA stored in ethanol or OGLFix can also be used, as long as samples are not stored for a long time. It is very important that we all make the upmost effort to ensure that the samples are collected using sterile materials and appropriate technique, and that samples are well preserved, with the method of preservation well documented. Care and attention in sample collection for DNA extraction will ensure that time and resources are spent on good quality samples and are the first steps to obtaining a robust and reliable dataset.\n\n\n\n\nPrepare ahead of time: All sample vials used to store tissue for DNA extraction should be sterilized by autoclaving ahead of time. Screw-cap cryovials are preferred (Fisher, cat #10-500-26). Be sure to get trained (online course and in-person training by OGL personnel) before using the autoclave. Make a list of all other materials needed to collect samples and autoclave what is autoclavable ahead of time. Remember to gather boxes, gloves and other PPE.\nSmart label and metadata: In general, it is best practice to have tubes organized in a box, with at least 2 labels on each tube (in case one falls off). We have a barcode label printer (with freezer-proof labels) that can be used. Label the vials with species name or initials, and sample ID. Make sure to have unique sample IDs for each sample for your entire project. Label boxes with species name, project name, your initials, sampling date and location ahead of time. Make a spreadsheet listing the sample IDs and columns to record all other info and data about the study site, individuals and samples (lat/long, size and weight of animals, experimental treatment, etc).\nAvoid cross-contamination: If possible, use a sterilized surface to handle or collect tissue or samples. Sterilize surface with 10% bleach, UV light and/or 70% ethanol, or use sterile plastic weigh boats. Always wear gloves. For anything that comes in contact with the animals and samples, use sterile disposable materials, one per individual, whenever possible. If using blades, use sterile blades or wipe each blade and all other materials (forceps, spatulas, etc) with 70% ethanol between individuals to avoid cross-contamination. If available, flame the blades to burn off the excess ethanol and further sterilize them. Be sure to get all bits of tissue off the blade and into the sample vial. Remember to dispose of sharps in a sharps container.\nAmount of tissue sample: Collect an appropriate amount of tissue, so there will be enough sample to repeat or troubleshoot extraction if needed, and to archive the remaining tissue for future studies, to use as positive controls, etc. Typically, that means 1 to 1.5 inch piece of tissue. Use your best judgment to make sure that the entire tissue sample is submersed in fixative liquid (if that is your method of preservation). A sample that is too small may not yield enough DNA to proceed with sequencing and a sample that is too big for the vial may not be preserved well as the amount of preservative liquid in the vial may not permeate the whole tissue (see photo below).\nStorage: Samples can be stored temporarily in liquid N2 but should be stored short term in the -20oC freezer and long term in the -80oC freezer. Minimize the amount of time that you keep the -80oC freezer door open and do not let the temperature rise above -70oC (this will set off the freezer alarms). Be mindful of the location you select to store your boxes in the -80oC freezer - we have an inventory that needs to be checked ahead of time and filled out to keep track of where samples are. Using the inventory helps minimizing the time that de freezer door is open when storing or retrieving boxes.\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to get trained by OGL personnel beforehand if using the liquid N2 dispenser at NUMSC. Place tissue into labelled cryovials. Make sure to use liquid N2 and -80oC freezer proof labels so they do not fall off. Use protective equipment to handle liquid N2: cryogenic gloves, closed-toe shoes, lab coat and goggles. Dispense liquid N2 into the dewar flask. Place a sample vials on a long-handle strainer and slowly submerse the strainer into liquid N2 in the dewar, releasing the cryovials into the liquid. If flash-freezing samples in the lab, wait 1-2 min and retreive the vials using the strainer. Make sure to retreive all vials from the dewar. Place cryovials in a storage box and transfer the box to the -80oC freezer. These cryovials are used for flash-freezing and temporary storage-only in liquid N2. If flash-freezing away from the lab, make sure to transfer vials to storage boxes and into the -80oC freezer as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nUse regular grade 95% ethanol. Calculate how much ethanol will be needed for all samples you are collecting and pour that volume plus little extra from the stock ethanol container (stored into the flammables cabinet) into a beaker or another container of appropriate volume. You may need to adjust the concentration of ethanol, e.g., from 100% to 95% - use ultrapure water (MiliQ) or molecular grade water to do this dilution. Pre-fill screw-cap vials with 1.5-2mL of 95% ethanol using a pipette. Make sure to sumberse the whole tissue into ethanol so the liquid can permeate the whole tissue (see photo below). If samples preserved in ethanol are being shipped via FedEx, UPS, etc, you might need a Special or Hazardous Shipping form, label and to follow specific packaging instructions. Contact lab manager before shipping containers with ethanol.\n\n\n\nOGLFix can be used instead of ethanol to preserve tissue for DNA extraction. Follow the same instructions described above for ethanol (no dilution needed). OGLFix can be shipped without hazardous designation. As for ethanol preservation, it is critical the the entire tissue is submersed in fixative. Refer to the OGLFix sampling protocol for detailed instructions.\nSampling protocol immerse\nSamplingprotocolsize",
