## Protocols

### Starting up and connecting your laptop

1.  Opentrons pipetting OT-2 robot is located in the MSC shared equipment lab.

2.  Make sure the power cable and USB cable are plugged into the robot and wall.

3.  Download the [Opentrons app](https://opentrons.com/ot-app/). Do not open it yet.

4.  Turn on the robot with the power switch on its back left side. Make sure the blue light on the front of the machine is solid and not flashing and that you hear machinery start-up noises. Start-up can take a minute or two.

5.  [Connect](https://support.opentrons.com/s/article/Get-started-Connect-to-your-OT-2-over-USB) your computer to the USB cable attached to the OT-2. Then, open the Opentrons app after the robot is fully on (troubleshooting [here](https://support.opentrons.com/s/article/Troubleshooting-connection-problems).

6.  In the app, go to the **“Devices”** tab in the left panel. Select the OT-2 robot. 

**Note**:It may take a few minutes for your computer to acknowledge the robot. If after several minutes the robot does not appear, close out of the app, turn the machine off and on, and try the connection steps again.

7.  Install any robot or app updates if prompted (robot updates take several minutes).

  - You may need to restart the robot and exit and re-enter the app to begin step two of the robot updates. It seems to be a finnicky process.

  - The blue light on the top left of the robot will begin flashing once it has begun downloading the update.

  - The robot may restart itself as part of the update process.

  - The flashing should stop when the update is complete.

### Mounting Pipet Arms
1.  Remove everything from the robot deck (tip racks, wells, etc.).

2.  Under Devices, select the robot.

3.  Under Pipettes and Modules, click on the three dots for either the left or right pipette mount.

4.  If there is already a pipette in the mount, select detach pipette.

5.  When ready, select “Attach pipette” from the submenu.

6.  Click on “Move pipette to front” and wait for the arm to stop moving forward.

7.  On the next page that pops us, select the pipette model (all our tips are Gen1) and the volume.

8.  Bring the pipette onto the mount.

9. Align the small dots on the back of the pipette with the matching prongs toward the top of the mount.

10. Find the hex screwdriver (should be on lower shelf to the left of the machine).

11. If mounting a multi-channel pipette, place the ends of the pipette on the deck so all are evenly resting on the surface. The pipette should still be aligned with the prongs on the mount.

12. Screw in the screws according to the diagram below. Push in the white connector tag until you feel it move.

13. In the Opentrons app, prompt the robot to check the connection. If the connection fails, try pushing the white tag in more. Check connection again.

### Deck Calibration
**Note**: Deck calibration only needs to be done once or twice a year, so you can likely skip this step and head straight to pipette calibration.

1.  Select the robot from **"Devices"** and click the three dots on the top right of the page.

2.  Go to **"Robot Settings."**

3.  Under Deck Calibration, select **“Recalibrate Deck.”**

4.  Follow calibration instructions as prompted by the app.

### Pipette Calibration
  
1.  Once the pipette connection is established, click on the calibration pop-up. Pop-up may not show up if the arm has been recently calibrated.

2.  Follow instructions in the app to complete offset and tip-length calibration. 

### Protocol Upload and Runs

1.  Save the protocol you want to run to your laptop. 

  - Thus far, .json and .py files have been compatible. The non-coding protocol designer's default file output format is .json. Protocols from the public library tend to be in .py format.

2. In the Opentrons app, go to the **"Protocols"** tab. Select the blue **"Import"** tab in the top right.

3.  Select **"Choose File"** or drag and drop your protocol in. Once it uploads, it should be visible in an alphabetized list uner **"Protocols"**.

4.  Click on the protocol. Select **"Run Protocol."** The app will prompt you to select the OT-2 robot. Then click **"Proceed to setup."**

5.  Ensure the deck view in the app matches the way you have the deck setup with materials.

6. Click **"Start run."**
