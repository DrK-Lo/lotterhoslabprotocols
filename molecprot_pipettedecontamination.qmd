# Pipette Internal Decontamination

So, (Captain America pulls up a chair) you've accidentally sucked some sample up into the pipette comb, contaminating the inside of the pipette. You can't keep using that pipette without possbily contaminating other samples. Not to worry, you can disassemble, decontaminate, autoclave, and reassemble the pipette. Here's how.

## Disassembling the Pipette for Decontamination

Ref. pages: 21-29

### Single Channel



### Multichannel 

1. Set the pipette volume to the highest end of its range (the nominal value)

  - For example, on the 20-300 uL pipette, set the volume to 300 uL

2. There's a lever at the base of where the pipette handle meets the lower part with the combs. Push it to one side and hold it there to remove the lower part from the handle.

3. On the right and left sides of the lower part, there are two locking mechanisms. With the lower part hanging combs-down, push both locking mechanisms down. You can now remove the cover plate of the pipette combs.

4. When you open the pipette, you'll see the row of tip cones with pistons. Gently remove each piston. First pull the top of the piston forward, then pull it up and out of the tip cone.

5. Remove the tip cones. Push one cone up into the pipette until you can pull the bottom part of the cone forward and out of the rack. The cones are spring-loaded, so do this step slowly to avoid the cone being flung out of the rack.

6. Pull the rest of the tip cone along with the spring out of the rack.

## Decontamination

1. Using a kimwipe, gently wipe any grease off of the pistons.

2. Place the tip cones and pistons in a 10% bleach bath for 30 min. See [this protocol](https://drk-lo.github.io/lotterhoslabprotocols/molecprot_solutionrecipes.html) for how to make the bath. 100 mL of the bath placed in one of the larger plastic weigh boats should be enough to submerge the pipette parts.

  - Remove the springs from the tipcones before placing the cones in the bath. Bleach causes metal to rust, so **don't put the springs in the bath**.

3. Make sure all cones and pistons are completely submerged and that the interiors of the cones have no air bubbles. Generally, if the cones are sitting on the bottom of the boat and aren't floating, there likely aren't bubbles in them. If they're floating, try to gently tap the cone against the bottom of the boat to release bubbles.

4. After 30 min, remove the cones and pistons from the bath and rinse them well in DI water. You can fill another weigh boat with DI water and rinse each piece in that bath. 

## Autoclaving

1. The entire pipette is able to be autoclaved, including the handle and the lower part with the tip cones. Place the pistons, tip cones, and springs into a glass beaker to autoclave them. The rest of the pipette can simply be autoclaved as is.

2. Autoclave at 121 degrees C for 40 min, allowing 20 extra minutes for depressurization.

3. Make sure the pipette is completely dry before reassembling it. You may want to allow the pipette to dry overnight to be sure.
