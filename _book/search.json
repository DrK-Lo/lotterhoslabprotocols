If you have any questions after reading through this, don’t be afraid to ask other members of the lab (and write the questions down so we can add it to this page :D).\n\nSafety First\nThis will help you know where certain items are in the lab that will help keep you and others safe:\n\nSafety Data Sheets and Hazardous Waste:\n\nAll safety data sheets, chemical inventory and hazardous waste labels are in this binder… \n\nHazardous Waste:\n\nClean Harbors now does pick up and transportation of chemical waste containers. They will come around to each of the labs that have filled out the online pick up sheet on the last Tuesday of every month.\nAt this same time, Clean harbors should bring the extra hazardous waste containers that have been requested by members of the lab.\nIf our secondary containment is overflowing in the middle of the month, notify Ryan and he will transport the containers to the central accumulation area.\nLastly, do your best to fill out the hazardous waste labels correctly. Use the SDS of the chemical that you have been working with to help fill out the label.\n\n\n\n\nShared Lab Space\n\nThe first door on the right as you enter the hall where labs are located is the shared lab space. Here is where you will be able to find most of the equipment that you need that is not in the lab.\n\nOpenTrons pipetting robot\nBluePippin - DNA Size Selection for Next-Gen Sequencing\nSonicator - DNA Shearing\nAgilent TapeStation - Quantification and quality assessment of RNA, DNA (including genomic DNA) and protein samples.\nSynergy HTX (‘Plate reader’) - DNA Quantification of a large amount of samples.\nCentrifuge - Centrifuging large volume containers (Falcon tubes).\n\nWhile using the equipment is encouraged whenever it is needed, it is necessary that you log your use on the common lab space spreadsheet for auditing purposes.\n\nIt is also important to log your uses of other shared equipment such as the autoclave, gel imager, NanoDrop, etc.\n\n\n\n\nComputing\n\nOur lab and some other labs at the MSC have access to a computing cluster (defiance) so we can run scripts and simulations that may take days to run. Refer to this page in order to gain access and learn how to use defiance."

All boxes on the shelf if opened can only be used on the pre-PCR bench.\nAll benches that will be used for your molecular work for the day should be cleaned with 10% bleach then 70% ethanol. You should also do this after your done working for the day.\nIf using the UV hood for RNA work, all supplies that will be used for said work need to be placed in the UV hood and then light should be turned on for 1 hour to sterilize everything. DO NOT PUT YOUR SAMPLES IN THE UV HOOD WHEN THE LIGHT IS ON!\nGloves should be used when touching anything on all molecular benches, shelves above those benches (except the first shelf labeled with pink tape),fridge, -20oC freezer.\n\nNO GLOVES IN HALLS OR TOUCHING DOOR HANDLES. Can have one glove on but the other hand free to open doors.\nKeyboards in shared molecular space have labels for whether you should operate with or without gloves. Pay attention to these labels.\n\nFiltered tips are used for all molecular work (as budget allows). Fisherbrand tips are to be used ONLY ONLY ONLY with the multichannel pipettes.\n-80oC freezer is linked to a alarm system to alert us if it goes below -70oC. If you have to take samples/reagents out or in please work quickly and efficiently to ensure it does not drop below that temperature. If you need to do a lot of reorganizing the -80, take breaks to allow the temperature to come back down to ~ -80oC.\nThe layout of the -80oC freezer can be found https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12TA0x9hPe6B8G34A2ID93ebjxdaGcEiMHAAajCyuQqo/edit#gid=0 please see current Grad Student (Sara Schaal or Alan Downey-Wall) to get training on how to fill out this document.\n-20oC freezer has a general layout with the top shelf for main stocks, second shelf aliquots of kits and other reagents, third shelf is for DNA/RNA extractions, fourth shelf for tissue samples for DNA/RNA extraction."

    "text": "Defrosting the -80C freezer\nCryoCube-F570 operating manual\n\nTo do ahead of time:\n1) Find a backup freezer for the samples and confirm that there’s enough space for all contents of our freezer; check the dimensions of the available shelves in the backup freezer to see if it is the same as ours (ideally, transfer whole racks to the equivalent shelf & rack position on the backup freezer to save time and avoid messing up the inventory).\n2) Find help - defrosting can be done by one person, but having a second pair of hands is very helpful and strongly recommended.\n3) Familiarize yourself with the protocol to disable freezer alarms (see above), with the materials that need to be on hand to defrost & clean the freezer and the overall protocol/timeline described below.\n\n\nThe day of transfer/defrost:\n4) Before you begin, double-check that the backup freezer(s)’ alarm was disabled (see above instructions); request that our alarm is disabled remotely for 24h by emailing Dennis Todd @ northeastern; gather:\n\nfreezer mittens\nlab cart\na mop or large towel\n‘wet floor’ sign\na cooler or large styrofoam box for lose boxes/bags\na bucket to collect water\nclean cloths to wipe the freezer\n\n5) WEARING FREEZER MITTENS, transfer whole racks to the backup freezer: place all 5 racks from one shelf on our lab cart; roll the cart to the backup freezer and place them on the equivalent shelf and in the same order as they were on our freezer. Do this one shelf at the time until the freezer is empty.\n\ntransfer racks in and out of freezers carefully but quickly to minimize temp rising - note that the drawers slide open, so keep the racks horizontal; monitor both freezer’s temp as you transfer - shouldn’t rise above -65oC.\n\n6) Once empty:\n\nput up a “wet floor” sign,\nclose the CO2 cylinder valve,\nswitch off the local alarm box located on top of the freezer,\nunlock the switch locking plate (front-bottom-right side of the freezer) and switch off the battery (top) and the main (bottom) switches,\nunplug the freezer from the wall,\nopen all doors and let the freezer defrost, use a bucket to catch water dripping from the doors, use a mop to dry up the puddles.\n\n7) Once defrosted: wipe the whole interior of the freezer, the inner and outer doors and the seal using clean microfiber cloths (under the lab sink) until completely dry.\n8) Reverse to bring freezer back up: close all doors, plug freezer back up, switch on main switch/battery switch and lock up the locking plate, switch on alarm box up on top of the freezer. Monitor temperature to ensure that it is appropriately decreasing all the way to -80oC.\n\nduring this stage, the freezer alarm may go off (not the alarms associated with the remote system), just mute it using the door pannel keys.\n\n\n\nRefill our freezer (at least 24h after temp is back to -80oC on the empty freezer)\n9) Disable our freezer alarm for 1h (instructions above). Set a timer for yourself for 55 min because you might need to extend alarm cancellation. Check with the host lab on whether the alarm on the backup freezer needs to be disabled.\n10) WEARING FREEZER MITTENS transfer freezer racks back and ensure they are placed back on the freezer position (shelf & row) where they before - so it continues to match the freezer database. Leave one or two empty racks in the freezer for new boxes. Monitor the temperature of both freezers during retrieval to ensure it does not raise above 65oC.\n11) If you need to take a break to allow the temperature to drop, remember to extend the alarm cancellation for another hour.\n12) Once all samples are back, wait around and make sure that the freezer temp drops down to -80oC.\n\n\nExample timeline:\nOctober 2021 defrost (Thais, Sara and Alan):\n\nOGL was able to hold our samples (MUST coordinate with OGL personnel ahead of time); OGL’s freezers was completely empty, and shelves have the same dimensions as ours (plus an extra shelf); their freezer was not hooked up to an alarme system at the time.\nWe were able to transfer all racks to the equivalent positions into the backup freezer (one shelf at the time) without needing to wait too long for the temperature to stabilize. Because the backup freezer was empty, the temp rose to -58oC when we transferred the first shelf/5 racks.\nOur freezer was defrosted, cleaned/dried and turned back on within 2 hours.\nTransfer-defrost-cleaning took from 11am to 2pm.\nTemp down to -80oC within another 2-3 hours (all done by 5pm).\nThe CO2 valve was reopened the following day.\nThe following week, we transferred the racks back. Temp went up to 65oC after 3 shelves were tranferred so we took 1h break, then tranferred the remaining racks and samples.\nTook about 2h for the temp to go back down to -80oC (freezer alarm went off once)."

For liquid waste, let him know specifically which containers to pickup (for example, put all containers to be picke up in a separate tray inside the Satelite Accumulation Area and leave a note on the tray saying - “please pickup all 3 bottles inside this tray”).

As soon as a new chemical/kit is delivered to our lab, assign it a barcoded label. You MUST use the barcoded labels provided by Northeastern’s EHS. They start with “NU000” followed by a unique ID number.\nAlways place the label where it is easier to see (i.e., not on the bottom of the container, where you’d have to lift the bottle to find it).

A CAS Registry Number itself has no inherent chemical significance but provides an unambiguous way to identify a chemical substance or molecular structure when there are many possible systematic, generic, proprietary or trivial names. CAS Registry Numbers are used in many other public and private databases as well as chemical inventory listings and, of course, are included in all CAS-produced databases. ↩︎"

It is important to be as specific as possible (e.g. kit manufacturer, name of the piece of equipment you used) to ensure the results are reproducible.\nA well-framed research question should allow you to write the introduction before the results are known. In the Introduction you should lay out the rationale for the study, including the questions or hypotheses to be addressed.\nI find it helpful to draw text from the papers I am citing or reading if I get stuck in a writing block, and then going back to edit it later.\nAs you start to work on a section, the most important thing is to maintain communication and discussions with all authors, especially if what you write strays from the outline. You may be wasting effort and taking the manuscript in a direction that is different from what others envision.\nAdding comments to sections that you are working on and how you plan to improve them, or questions you have on how to improve them, can help co-authors understand where your thought process is."

I have read over manuscripts 10+ times and there are still errors.\nEdit for unneccessary words or long sentences.\nAttention to detail is paramount. Every error that a reviewer finds is a mental check that other important details may have been overlooked in the research.\nWriting Author Contributions. Communication here is paramount.

There is an “Line Numbers for Google Docs Add On”\nEdit all references in the Bibliography (this is the very last thing you do). Paperpile often has errors, especially with capitalization. You do not want to have a reviewer find their name was spelled wrong in your reference list, so check also for special characters. Species italics is another thing that often needs to be edited."

This means as it evaporates the remaining liquid will still be at 95.6%\nWhen adding wet tissues to 95% ethanol, it can decrease the concentration of ethanol. It can be helpful to change the ethanol after the first few months.\nMore information on other ways to preserve tissues are found in this article"

The main points are summarized here:\n\nAlthough it may seem counter-intuitive, 70% ethanol seems to be the most effective concentration, as 90% ethanol coagulates the protein, and the protein layer that is created effectively renders the cell dormant. At a 70% concentration, however, the ethanol takes longer to evaporate and this longer contact time means that it is able to penetrate cells more effectively. The water in a 70% grade is also important in denaturing proteins. And 70% ethanol also tends to be cheaper and is less flammable."

    "text": "There are a couple of things to watch out for when diluting ethanol:\n\nFirst, diluted ethanol is no longer an azeotrope. At 70%, ethanol will evaporate faster than water, so evaporative loss will result in a gradual decrease in ethanol concentration in the remaining solution. Don’t be surprised when an unsealed beaker of 70% ethanol ‘stops working’. So don’t make more than is necessary at a time, and make sure to label the date when it was made (which you should do for everything you make anyway).\nSecond, ethanol/water mixtures don’t have additive volumes. That means that if you want to make 1 liter of 70% ethanol from absolute ethanol, you can’t do it by mixing 700 ml of ethanol and 300 ml of water. The correct method is to measure 700 ml of ethanol and then bring it to a volume of 1 liter with water.\n\nWhy? When you mix water and ethanol, the ethanol molecules occupy the space between the water molecules. A helpful way to visualize this is to think about sand and rocks – if you were to mix 1 liter of each, the final volume would be less than 2 liters because the sand would fall between the rocks."

    "text": "Use 100% (200 Proof, absolute ethanol, molecular grade) non-denatured Ethanol for Molecular Biology work\n\nSomething about the process of making ethanol makes it hard to get from 95% to 100%. Sometimes this contains additives to get it up to 100%, but they are not denaturing agents.\nSome procedures that are sensitive to the presence of water require absolute ethanol.\nA common method to produce ethanol with a higher concentration than 95% is to use additives that disrupt the azeotrope composition and allow further distillation. For this reason, absolute ethanol sometimes contains trace amounts of these additives (such as benzene). source"

    "section": "",
    "text": "First, you should make a plan for the adapters that you are going to use for each sample. As you choose adapters, you want to ensure that there is not low diversity in the indexes or in the first 5-6 bases of every read. Low diversity can result in high error rates because of an unbalanced color scheme as explained here by Illumina:\nIllumina Low Plex Pooling Guidelines\nThe term “nucleotide diversity” describes the proportion of each nucleotide (A, T, C, and G) at each position in a sequencing library. A “balanced” or “diverse” library has equal proportions of A, C, G, and T nucleotides at each base position in a sequencing library. In particular, nucleotide diversity is key during the first 4–7 cycles of Read 1 for all Illumina sequencing systems. The sequencing software uses images from these early cycles to identify the location of each cluster in a process called template generation. This results in overclustering. Overclustering creates image analysis problems, including loss of focus, poor template generation, and issues with cluster registration. The increased overall signal brightness of the flow cell makes it difficult for the sequencer to read and find the appropriate focal plane.\nIllumina Consequences of Overclustering\nNext, and especially if you are doing library prep for the first time, I suggest that you draw out what is happening to the DNA or RNA at every step of the process:\nExample Genomic Library Prep with p5 inline barcode and index in p7 PCR Primer\nExample Library prep with inline barcodes and dual indexes\nFor genomic DNA library prep, we are now working with inline barcodes on the P5 (left) adapter and indexes on the P7 (right) adapter. See above figure for details (note: KEL thinks there is issues with this system and this may change). These can give up to 12*12 = 144 unique barcodes. But, keep in mind that every sample can’t have the same barcode (e.g., can’t have 12 samples with 1 barcode and 12 indexes), and every sample can’t have the same index (e.g., can’t have 12 samples with 12 barcodes and 1 index) because of the low-diversity problem.\nAlso, note that the indexes will also demultiplex with Illumina’s software at the sequencing facility. But after you receive them, the reads will need to be further demultiplexed using the inline barcodes with a program such as STACKS.\nLotterhos adapter and primer database\nLotterhos y-adapters with inline barcodes and dual indexes"

Sterilize surfaces and area around the scale - wipe with with 10 % bleach first, then DI H2O, then 70-90% EtOH.\nD1-3. Remove tissue samples from freezer and let thaw (do not let them sit any longer than necessary). Take ~10 samples at the time. Once thawed they can be placed on ice/cold beads.\nD1-4. Pre-load lysis plate or sterile eppendorf tubes with 200 uL of TL buffer per well plate or tube using a serile pipette tip.\nD1-5. Tare scale with a piece of weighing paper on it.\nD1-6. Dip ONLY the cutting edge of the blade into EtOH in beaker. Move the beaker aside. Hold the blade vertically, away from your body and away from the EtOH beaker and flame the blade. When all EtOH has burned off and the flame is gone, set the sterile blade on a clean kimwipe on the bench. Dip the tip of the forceps into EtOH beaker, move the beaker aside. Hold the forceps horizontally, away from your body and from the EtOH beaker and flame the forceps to sterilize.\nD1-7. Using the sterile forceps, carefully remove tissue from 2mL tube and set it on the kimwipe. Using the sterile razor blade, cut a piece of tissue 15-20 mg. Pat dry the piece of tissue with a clean kimwipe, so that the tissue appears nearly dry.\nD1-8. Place tissue on weigh paper and record the weight in lab notebook. If the tissue weights less than 15mg or more than 20mg, remove or add more tissue as needed to reach this range.\nD1-9. Take the weigh paper out of the scale, set it on a clean kimwipe and use the sterile forceps and blade to cut up the tissue into smaller pieces.\nD1-10. Transfer the cut up tissue to a well plate or an eppendorf tube, making sure that all pieces of tissue fall into the buffer.\nD1-11. Label the tube with sample ID, or keep track of the plate layout on your lab notebook, so you know which samples are in which wells.\nD1-12. Discard the used blade into the sharps container.

Add 25uL of OB Protease Solution (OB Protease and Proteinase K, provided with the kit, serve the same purpose as digestive buffers) to each sample tube or well plate. You can reuse the tip if you are sure that the tip did not touch the liquid or the sides of the tubes or wells. If the tip does touch any surfaces in the lysis plate or tubes, replace with a sterile tip.\nD-15. Close tubes or seal plate with a silicone mat, confirm all tubes or plate wells are labelled correctly and vortex the tubes/plate for 15 seconds.\nD-16. Place samples on thermomixer. Before restarting the mixer: Make sure all tube caps are securely fastened/plate is securely sealed. In addition, after 2 minutes on the thermomixer confirm the tube caps/silicone mat have not popped open.\nNote: Samples can be left for at least 3 hours or overnight to allow for all tissue to be completely lysed. If possible, pause the mixer, take plate/tubes out and vortex them for 15 sec every 1/2h to 1h to help with lysis.\n\n\nDay 2 of extraction - DNA purification.\nD2-1. Sterilize bench top - wipe with with 10% bleach first, then DI H2O, then 70-90% EtOH.\nD2-2. Heat up heating block (or check oven temperature in Hughes lab) to 70oC and place the volume needed of elution buffer (or molecular grade water) in it.\nD2-3. Follow the kit manual for plates or individual tubes for DNA purification with the following modifications, if needed:\n\nskip the optional step “add RNAase”\nskip the optional step “column equilibration”\nwhen centrifuging the lysis plate and the E-Z 96 DNA plate (mini-columns plate), tape them together.\nskip the optional step “dry samples at 70oC”\nwe prefer to use molecular grade water as the elution buffer instead of the kit buffer.\nelution volume may vary depending on starting material and extraction yield. Minimum volume is 30 uL, to ensure that the entire memembrane is soaked with elution buffer.\nthe second elution can be eluted into a separate tube, if there are concerns about DNA concentration in the first elution.\nAlign the tubes in the centrifuge in this manner: \n\nD2-4. You will likely need to spot-check the concentration of your extracted DNA, either by Qubit or Picogreen assay. Both are destructive assays, meaning you will need to use some aliquote (typically 1-2 uL) of your eluted DNA to measure concentration. Make note of how much you used from which samples, to keep track of how much is available for downstream library prep and sequencing.\nD2-5.

Larger pieces of tissue, very hard or fibrous tissues, and tissues with a high RNase content must typically be ground to a powder in liquid nitrogen for maximum RNA yield.\nHomogenizing tissue: Homogenize samples in 10–20 volumes TRI Reagent solution (e.g., 1 mL TRI Reagent solution per 50–100mg tissue), using standard homogenization procedures.\n\nThe sample volume should not exceed 10% of the volume of TRI Reagent solution used for homogenization.\n\n\nIncubate the homogenate for 5 min at room temp.\n\nThis 5 min room temperature incubation allows nucleoprotein complexes to completely dissociate.\nHomogenized samples can be stored at –70°C for at least one month.\n\n(Optional) Centrifuge at 12,000 xg for 10 min at 4°C and transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube.\n\nThis optional centrifugation is only required to remove insoluable material from homogenates that contain high amounts of protein, fat, polysaccharide, or extracellular material, such as muscle, fat tissue, and tuberous parts of plants. Centrifugation pellets, extracellular membranes, polysaccharides, and high molecular weight DNA, leaving the RNA in the supernatant. High molecular weight DNA can be recovered from the pellet by following the wash and solubilization steps of the DNA isolation protocol, available here\n\nAdd 100 μL BCP per 1 mL of TRI Reagent solution, mix well, and incubate at room temp for 5–15 min.\n\nAdd 100 μL BCP per 1 mL of TRI Reagent solution used for homogenization. Alternatively, 200 μL of chloroform (without isoamyl alcohol) can be used in place of BCP.\nCap the tubes tightly and shake vigorously for 15sec.\nIncubate the mixture at room temperature for 5–15 min.\n\nCentrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10–15 min at 4°C, then transfer the aqueous phase to a fresh tube.\n\nCentrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10–15 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the aqueous phase (colorless top layer) to a fresh tube.\nRNA remains exclusively in the aqueous phase whereas DNA and protein are in the interphase and organic phase.\nThe interphase and lower, red, organic phase can be stored at 4°C for subsequent isolation of DNA and protein. A protocol is posted here\n\nAdd 500 μL of isopropanol per 1 mL of TRI Reagent solution, vortex for 5–10 sec, and incubate at room temp for 5–10 min.\n\nAdd 500 μL of isopropanol per 1 mL of TRI Reagent solution used for sample homogenization.\nVortex at moderate speed for 5–10 sec.\nIncubate the samples at room temp for 5–10 min.\nNote For oysters, we use a modified protocol:\n\nTransfer the aqueous phase from step 5 to a fresh tube. For each 1 mL of TRI Reagent solution used for the homogenization, add 250 μL of isopropanol and 250 μL of a high salt precipitation solution (e.g. 0.8 M sodium citrate and 1.2 M NaCl).\nMix well, store for 5–10 min at room temperature, and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 8 min at 4–25°C.\nWash the resulting RNA pellet as described in steps 8 and 9 of the procedure.\n\n\nCentrifuge at 12,000 x g for 8 min at 4–25°C, and discard the supernatant.\n\nCentrifuge at 12,000 x g for 8 min at 4–25°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\n\nPrecipitated RNA forms a gel-like or white pellet on the side and bottom of the tube.\n\n\nAdd 1 mL of 75% ethanol per 1 mL of TRI Reagent solution.\n\nAdd 1 mL of 75% ethanol per 1 mL TRI Reagent solution used for sample homogenization to each sample to wash the RNA pellets.\n\nCentrifuge at 7,500 x g for 5 min, remove the ethanol, and briefly air dry the RNA pellet.\n\nCentrifuge at 7,500 x g for 5 min at 4–25°C.\n\nIf the precipitated RNA floats or does not form a compact pellet, repeat the centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 5 min to consolidate the pellet at the bottom of the tube.\n\nRemove the ethanol wash without disturbing the pellet.\nRemove all residual ethanol by centrifuging again briefly and removing the ethanol that collects with a fine tip pipette. Complete removal of ethanol is necessary for the RNA to perform well in downstream applications.\nAir dry the RNA pellet for 3–5min.\n\nDo not completely dry the RNA pellet as this will greatly decrease its solubility. Do not dry RNA by vacuum centrifugation. 10.Dissolve RNA in the buffer of your choice.\n\nDissolve RNA in THE RNA Storage Solution (P/N AM7000, AM7001), Nuclease-free Water, or your choice of buffer‡ by passing the solution a few times through a pipette tip or by vigorous vortexing\nThe resuspension volume is determined by the size of the RNA pellet. 3–5 mm pellets typically require 300–500 μL. If necessary, increase the resuspension volume or incubate at 55–60°C to completely dissolve the pellet.\nStore at 4°C for immediate analysis. For long-term storage, store at –70°C or colder."

This will take a few minutes because the machine runs self diagnostics when booting up.\nOn the home screen, click “Quantitative PCR Fluoresence Probe” \nThe first screen that will pop up is your plate set up. Here click the top left corner of the plate to select all wells and in the bottom right corner change the dye from “FAM” to “SYBR”. This updates all wells to have the correct dye information for your run. \nNext for each well make sure to label as either a “Standard” well, “NTC” (no template control) well, or “Unknown” well. For example, to do this for standards, highlight all cells that are locations of standards and move to the top right corner dropdown menu called “Well Types” and set it to standard. You can click and drag to highlight multiple locations in a row or just click on all the cells individually. You can always deselect by clicking that cell again or deselect everything using the top left corner square. \nNext click on the left tab that says “Thermal Profile” and set the specifications for your run (Table 5). You do this by clicking any value (e.g., time or temperature) and manually editing the values as shown in the image below. \n\n\nTable 5:\n| Step | Temperature | Time | Cycles | |————————————–|————-|——–|——–| | Initial activation/denaturation | 95C | 5 min | 1 | | Denaturation | 95C | 30 sec | 35 | | Annealing/extension/data acquisition | 60C | 45 sec | * |\nThe denature and annealing steps are both run together for 35 cycles. Markdown tables are frustrating and you can’t merge cells of a table. See the image at the bottom of this section for clarification. Once the specifications are set properly, place the tubes in the qPCR machine and click “Run Experiment”."

Only this flash drive works (not sure why?). \nThen shut down the qPCR machine and take the flash drive to the tapestation computer. Here you should open the Agilent Aria program to see your data. \nOnce the program opens a similar table to what you saw on the qPCR machine will open. Standard cells will be a redish pink color, sample cells blue and no template control green. For the standard cells you need to manually enter each value into the program. This is done by highlighting one cell and moving to the properties tab on the right side panel. Then in the standard quantities section place the value of that standard in the “Amount” field and change the Units field to picograms. These values will correspond to the order you put your ladder in and are the values in Table 2. Double check all inputs once you complete all your standard wells then you are ready to view your results. \nHighlight all cells then move to the “Graphical Displays” to inspect your amplification plots and where your samples fall on your standard curve. You can do a visual inspection here to ensure your samples fall within your standards, but you need to export your Cq values to determine actually concentrations of your samples. \nTo export your Cq values make sure all samples are highlighted in the right hand column.

To be conservative we make the highest concentration for our ladder 500 ng/mL.\nSamples should be diluted to be read within this range. For example, typical quantifications for Atlantic cod DNA extractions using a spin column plate is between 10 - 200 ng/uL. Therefore, you should do a 1:10 dilution because the reaction does a 1:100 dilution in the reaction itself. This brings the final DNA concentration to 10 - 200 ng/mL which is well within the range of the assay.\nPicoGreen dye is a solid when stored at 4C. Allow the dye to come to room temperature before use. Take out the kit and leave on the counter before starting protocol to ensure it becomes a liquid. You can pipette TE and samples while it is coming to room temp.\nThe first column of your plate needs to be saved for the ladder standards. Therefore if you are using 6 standards as recommended in this protocol, the most samples you could run on a plate is 90."

This solution is stable long term so you can make more than you will need and store for later use. If you will not be using frequently, you can also calculate exactly how much you need and just make enough for that use.\nCreate your ladder standards using Table 1. The stock ladder is at 100 ug/mL. So for example, to make Dilution 1 at 2 ug/mL, combine 1 uL of stock ladder with 49 uL of 1X TE.\nPipette 49 uL of 1X TE in all sample wells and the appropriate volume of 1X TE into each standard well according to Table 2. For example for standard 1 pipette 25 uL of 1X TE in the appropriate well.\nAdd 1 uL of sample to each of the sample wells and the appropriate amount of each ladder to the standard wells according to Table 2. For example, add 25 uL of Ladder Dilution 1 to standard 1 well.\nAt this point your PicoGreen should be at room temperature. Create your Diluted PicoGreen and use Equation 1 to determine how much stock PicoGreen dye you need for the number of samples/standards you are running. Then use that value to calculate the amount of 1X TE this should be added to for a 200 times dilution using Equation 2.\nPipette diluted PicoGreen to each well with each well getting 50 uL of the 200 times diluted PicoGreen. When adding the diluted PicoGreen pipette up and down at least 20 times to mix sample, TE and PicoGreen together.\nUse a plate cover and briefly spin down the plate to get all liquid to the bottom of the well.\nRun plate on a Plate Reader using the Gen5 software.

Please pay special attention to steps 1.15 and 1.16 (elution of DNA off beads). To ensure optimal recovery, these steps may be performed at an elevated temperature: 37°C for 10 min. Elution buffer may be pre-heated for this step and/or the elution performed in a thermocycler or heating block.\nAs indicated above, a heated elution is recommended to ensure optimal recovery of high-quality genomic DNA. This is not a requirement for the cleanup of other DNA types (e.g. fragmented DNA).\nFor maximum recovery of the original DNA sample during cleanup, buffer exchange, and/or concentration of genomic DNA, fragmented DNA for NGS library construction, PCR or qPCR products—regardless of quality—a KAPA Pure Beads-to-sample volumetric ratio of 3X is recommended. Expected recoveries are 50 – 90%, depending upon sample quality and quantity. If a lower ratio is used, it may result in lower yields and exclusion of smaller fragments."

    "text": "Factors that Impact Overall Performance\n\nStore at 2°C to 8°C in a constant-temperature refrigerator; do not store at -20°C. Always ensure that KAPA Pure Beads is fully equilibrated to room temperature before use.\nFor optimal performance, always ensure that the KAPA Pure Beads is equilibrated to room temperature, that the beads are fully resuspended before use, and that the DNA and bead solutions are thoroughly mixed prior to the binding incubation.\nThe volumetric ratio of KAPA Pure Beads to sample is the critical factor in determining the size distribution of DNA fragments retained by the beads. The volume (ratio) may be modified/optimized based upon the specific application and/or point in the library construction workflow where a cleanup or size selection is employed.\nThe volume in which cleanups and size selection are performed may impact performance. DNA samples may be diluted in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 – 8.5) or PCR-grade water to increase the working volume prior to the addition of KAPA Pure Beads. This is recommended for starting volumes <50 µL, DNA preparations that are viscous, and/ or contain a high concentration of salts or PEG.\nIt is important to prepare fresh 80% ethanol prior to use, since ethanol absorbs atmospheric water.\nThe volume of 80% ethanol used for bead washes may be adjusted to accommodate different plate/tube volumes and/or limited pipetting capacity, but it is important that the beads are entirely submerged during the wash steps. Where possible, use a wash volume that is equal to the volume of sample plus KAPA Pure Beads.\nIt is important to remove all ethanol before proceeding with subsequent reactions. However, over-drying of beads may make them difficult to resuspend, and may result in a dramatic loss of DNA. Drying of beads for 3 – 5 min at room temperature should be sufficient. Drying of beads at 37ºC is not recommended.\nElution time and temperature may impact DNA recovery, particularly for high-molecular weight genomic DNA.\nPurified DNA in elution buffer should be stable at 4°C for 1 – 2 weeks, or for at least 1 month at -20°C. The long-term stability of library DNA at -20°C depends on a number of factors, including library concentration. Always use low DNA-binding tubes for long-term storage and avoid excessive freezing and thawing.\nTo increase the recovery of DNA at a specific stage in an NGS library construction protocol, the volume of KAPA Pure Beads used in the cleanup may be increased, but this will most likely result in the retention of smaller DNA fragments.\n\n\nUpper size limit | Modification\n\nIncrease upper size limit: Decrease the ratio of the first cut\nDecrease upper size limit: Increase the ratio of the first cut\n\n\n\nLower size limit | Modification\n\nIncrease lower size limit: Decrease the ratio of the second cut\nDecrease lower size limit: Increase the ratio of the second cut\nThe second size cut should be performed with at least 0.2 volumes of KAPA Pure Beads. Please note the volume of the KAPA Pure Beads needed for the second cut is calculated relative to the volume of the sample at the start of the size selection procedure, not the volume of the DNA-containing supernatant transferred after the first cut. DNA recovery is dramatically reduced if the difference between the first and second cuts is less than ~0.2  volumes. To increase the amount of DNA recovered, more than 0.2 volumes of KAPA Pure Beads may be used for the second cut, but note that this may result in the recovery of smaller library fragments and a broader size distribution."

It is also important to consider downstream analysis that may be affected by the method of preservation for collected samples. For example, best results for DNA extraction will come from flash-frozen DNA. For whole genome sequencing, DNA methylation and bisulfite sequencing, flash-frozen DNA is also the preferred collection method, but DNA stored in ethanol or OGLFix can also be used, as long as samples are not stored for a long time. It is very important that we all make the upmost effort to ensure that the samples are collected using sterile materials and appropriate technique, and that samples are well preserved, with the method of preservation well documented. Care and attention in sample collection for DNA extraction will ensure that time and resources are spent on good quality samples and are the first steps to obtaining a robust and reliable dataset."

    "text": "Tips\n\nPrepare ahead of time: All sample vials used to store tissue for DNA extraction should be sterilized by autoclaving ahead of time. Screw-cap cryovials are preferred (Fisher, cat #10-500-26). Be sure to get trained (online course and in-person training by OGL personnel) before using the autoclave. Make a list of all other materials needed to collect samples and autoclave what is autoclavable ahead of time. Remember to gather boxes, gloves and other PPE.\nSmart label and metadata: In general, it is best practice to have tubes organized in a box, with at least 2 labels on each tube (in case one falls off). We have a barcode label printer (with freezer-proof labels) that can be used. Label the vials with species name or initials, and sample ID. Make sure to have unique sample IDs for each sample for your entire project. Label boxes with species name, project name, your initials, sampling date and location ahead of time. Make a spreadsheet listing the sample IDs and columns to record all other info and data about the study site, individuals and samples (lat/long, size and weight of animals, experimental treatment, etc).\nAvoid cross-contamination: If possible, use a sterilized surface to handle or collect tissue or samples. Sterilize surface with 10% bleach, UV light and/or 70% ethanol, or use sterile plastic weigh boats. Always wear gloves. For anything that comes in contact with the animals and samples, use sterile disposable materials, one per individual, whenever possible. If using blades, use sterile blades or wipe each blade and all other materials (forceps, spatulas, etc) with 70% ethanol between individuals to avoid cross-contamination. If available, flame the blades to burn off the excess ethanol and further sterilize them. Be sure to get all bits of tissue off the blade and into the sample vial. Remember to dispose of sharps in a sharps container.\nAmount of tissue sample: Collect an appropriate amount of tissue, so there will be enough sample to repeat or troubleshoot extraction if needed, and to archive the remaining tissue for future studies, to use as positive controls, etc. Typically, that means 1 to 1.5 inch piece of tissue. Use your best judgment to make sure that the entire tissue sample is submersed in fixative liquid (if that is your method of preservation). A sample that is too small may not yield enough DNA to proceed with sequencing and a sample that is too big for the vial may not be preserved well as the amount of preservative liquid in the vial may not permeate the whole tissue (see photo below).\nStorage: Samples can be stored temporarily in liquid N2 but should be stored short term in the -20oC freezer and long term in the -80oC freezer. Minimize the amount of time that you keep the -80oC freezer door open and do not let the temperature rise above -70oC (this will set off the freezer alarms). Be mindful of the location you select to store your boxes in the -80oC freezer - we have an inventory that needs to be checked ahead of time and filled out to keep track of where samples are. Using the inventory helps minimizing the time that de freezer door is open when storing or retrieving boxes."

Dispense liquid N2 into the dewar flask. Place a sample vials on a long-handle strainer and slowly submerse the strainer into liquid N2 in the dewar, releasing the cryovials into the liquid. If flash-freezing samples in the lab, wait 1-2 min and retreive the vials using the strainer. Make sure to retreive all vials from the dewar. Place cryovials in a storage box and transfer the box to the -80oC freezer. These cryovials are used for flash-freezing and temporary storage-only in liquid N2.

Pre-fill screw-cap vials with 1.5-2mL of 95% ethanol using a pipette. Make sure to sumberse the whole tissue into ethanol so the liquid can permeate the whole tissue (see photo below).

This allows the RNAlater to permeate the tissues. Do not freeze samples in RNAlater® Solution immediately; READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. Typically we store at 4°C overnight (to allow the solution to thoroughly penetrate the tissue), remove supernatant, then move to –20°C or –80°C for long-term storage. Although, we have had good luck flash-freezing tissues in RNAlater.\nSamples can be stored in RNAlater at 4°C for one month, at 25°C for one week, or at –20°C indefinitely. Archive tissues treated with RNAlater solution at –20°C.\n\nIf any precipitation of RNAlater® Solution is seen, heat it to 37°C and agitate to redissolve it.\nIf the crystals do not go into solution at 37°C, loosen the cap and heat the solution at a higher temperature, up to 65°C, for ~30 minutes, mixing periodically. Once the crystals have dissolved, store the solution in smaller aliquots in case crystals re-form after cooling. Warming the solution in this way does not affect performance of RNAlater Solution."

Select the correct logger\nIf the logger has an expired calibration, you will be promoted to calibrate the logger. If it isn’t expired, you should still calibrate before deploying by selecting ‘pH Calibration’\nThis will open a window with a very easy-to-follow guide on how to calibrate the logger. We typically do a three-point calibration, so choose ‘Three-Point’ Follow the important tips at the bottom of the page. Namely, make sure the copper tip has been removed before calibrating and make sure the temperature logger is fully submerged when calibrating\n\nTip: Have the logger in the 7 pH buffer before clicking ‘Start Calibration’ and before clikcing ‘Next Buffer’ for the 4 and 10 pH buffers\nIf you put it in the wrong buffer or click ‘Next Buffer’ before putting the logger in, you should be able to place the logger in the buffer and it will properly stabilize\n\n\nConfiguring and Launching Logger\nAfter the logger has been calibrated you can configure it and launch it. To do so:\n\nChoose ‘Configure’ under the ‘Actions’ list\nSome things I would change: Name (to something meaningful like 20180615_Barnstable_pH), Logging Interval (typically 30 min), Start Logging (to the date and time it will be deployed, or ‘Now’ if relaunching), Stop Logging (make sure it’s on ‘When memory fills’), and make sure bluetooth is always on.\nClick ‘Start’ and the logger should launch at the date and time you set."

Use VCF tools to do this: http://vcftools.sourceforge.net/\n\nfor minor alleles < 0.05 (if you have a lot of SNPs, or 0.01 if you don’t have a lot of SNPs)\nfor missing data at SNPs (keep SNPs in at least X% of individuals in all dataset)\nfor missing data at population level (keeps SNPs with calls in X% or higher of individuals per population)\nfor individuals with low SNP count (keep individuals with higher than X% of SNPs called)\nDepending on the context, X% might be 80% or might be 100%\n\nTo use the bigsnpr R package, you will have to change your data from the VCF format to a genotype matrix with 0/1/2 counts of the alternate allele. Transform from vcf to (plink to) raw. See the first steps in this tutorial.\nThe presence of LD can bias principal components. This paper explains the problem.

GitHub is a great platform to track the changes in your work, share with collaborators, and have a backup online.\nRead more about using git in the terminal in Vince Buffalo’s textbook"

    "text": "How it is used in the lab…\nMost major projects in the lab will have their own git repository. If you are starting a project that will have a lot of coding involved, you should discuss with Katie about starting a new repository and how you will manage data, code, and directories. The easiest way to utilize GitHub is to do the following:\n\nMake sure you have GitHub Desktop downloaded (you can use the Terminal, but this is much more user-friendly, especially for beginners)\nLog in to your GitHub account (or create one if you don’t have one)\nFind the repository on GitHub that was created by Katie\nOn the main repository page you should see a green button towards the right of the screen that says ‘Clone or download’. Click this button\nYou can either copy the https and use git clone https... in the directory that you want the git repository, or you can choose ‘Open in Desktop’ which opens up the GitHub Desktop app, and allows you to choose which directory it will be cloned to.\nYou can then make changes on your local directory\nAfter you have made sufficient changes that you want to save and share, you need to commit these changes\nGitHub Desktop will keep track of these changes, which will appear in the left column of the app (make sure you’ve specified the right directory in the top navigation bar)\nTo commit these changes, select the changes you want to commit, then type a message in the summary box and click ‘Commit to <repository>’\n\nIt’s good practice to commit groups of changes separately depending on what you changed. For example, if you edited three text documents and added an image to the directory, you could commit the text documents with the summary ‘edited text documents’ then separately commit the image with the summary ‘added image’. This makes it so mass changes aren’t all assigned the same summary message\n\nThen in the upper right corner, on the black navigation bar, it should give you the option to push these commits to the main repository on GitHub. Do so by clicking on the box.\nIf changes have been made on the online GitHub repository, you will need to ‘pull’ these before pushing your commits (essentially, making sure you have the most up-to-date versions of files before making changes). You do this by choosing ‘pull’ in the upper right hand box, and then you can ‘push’ your changes."

Even if you are re-using scripts that are already located in another project’s folder, consider copying that code over into your new projects’ folder, instead of reading it from another location.\nThe guiding principle should be that you want to be able to run your whole project’s code (barring any software you have to download) using the scripts that are located within that projects’ folder. That way, if you ever have to move your project files to another computer, you won’t be missing any scripts on which you’re dependent.\nSo once you’ve made a new project folder, for example by using the mkdir command in the terminal\n> mkdir NewProject\nyou’ll want to navigate into that folder (cd NewProject) and create subdirectories to house specific file types.\nTwo good startig folders to have are a src folder and a results folder. An src folder (derived from “source”), should house all the core scripts necessary for your project. So all novel R scripts, Python code, Perl pipelines you’ve dredged up, etc. would be housed here. The results folder would house all output files generated by scripts in src.\nDepending on the project, you’ll want to have a data folder to keep the raw data sets that you yourself did not generate with the scripts in src.\nFinally, you’ll want to create a simple text README file that explicitly states what subdirectories you have in your project folder, and what they should contain. Ideally you should have a README file in each directory that states what files it contains.\nA README file written in markdown could look like this:\n# Files for New Project by Student McGee and PI ForFree, Year Month(s)\n\nShort description of New Project\n\n## Description of each folder or file and the data contained within:\n  src - What scripts are here?\n  results - What kind of result files are here?\n  data - What sort of data?\nOnce you’ve set up your project folder, it should look something like this: \nQuick notes: simfiles folder results folder src folder"

The pip command could be specifying either pip for python 2.7 or some version of python3. There should be a pip2.7 command to specify which of the two versions you are trying to use.

    "text": "57.4 Checking and managing resource usage on defiance\nDefiance is a shared resource, so it is important to monitor the resources being used in order to avoid overloading the server. Before beginning any resource-intensive analysis, you should log into comp5 and enter the command htop to bring up the following interface:\n\n\n\nhtop example\n\n\nOne way to immediately get a sense of whether too many resources are being used is to look at the load average, circled in red in this image. These 3 numbers represent the CPU load over the past minute, 5 minutes, and 15 minutes (from left to right). The higher the load average and the longer it has been high, the more concerned you should be. A spike in the load average for the past minute may be ok, but a sustained high load for the past 15 minutes means some processes need to be killed before the server crashes. How high is too high? A common rule of thumb is 0.70 x total number of CPUs. Since we have 72 CPUs on comp5, if you see the load above or approaching 50.0 you should wait for other jobs to finish before starting any new ones.\nThere is also a lot more information htop gives you that you can take into account. The top portion of the screen shows a real-time representation of how much load is on each of the 72 CPUs. In this image you can see that 2.0% of the total capacity of CPU number 38 is being used and none of the others are in use. Directly below the CPU grid is a bar showing the memory usage. 2.92 of 252 GB of memory is being used in this image. The bottom half of the htop display shows a list of processes currently running, the user they belong to, and information about the resources they are using.\nIf you want to check on your jobs only, you can use htop -u followed by your username (ex: htop -u freeman.k) to show only jobs started by your username. This can be useful to check how long your jobs have been running, to make sure they still are running and haven’t been terminated, or to see how much of the server’s capacity you are using.\nIf you would like to run a resource-intensive job without slowing down other jobs on the server, you can use the command nice when you start the job. nice -n 19 <your_program> will start your program with a “niceness” value of 19, meaning it will defer to all other processes when competing for CPU resources. The default niceness value is 0, 19 gives the lowest priority, and -20 gives the highest priority. Only the root user can run processes with negative niceness values."

Generally we like to leave a few available, so can parallelize code across up to 68 cores at once.\nFor genomics, we’re often doing tests for many loci. Depending on the test, it may be faster to run each locus in serial on a core, and spread out different parts of the data across several cores (as opposed to running each locus in serial across all cores in parallel).\nTo accomplish this, you will need a bash script and an R script. Examples are below.\nThe bash script takes in the total number of tests you want to do (number of loci or number of rows in a data frame, for instance), and then calculates how many should be run in serial on each core. It then runs through a loop. In each iteration of the loop (the total number of iterations should be equal to the number of cores), the bash script calls the R code and sends information about which rows in the dataframe are to be run in the R code. Each iteration of the loop calls R in the background on a different core.\nWithin the R code, another loop would be necessary to conduct the test for each row in the dataframe (not shown)."

Katie’s laptop from home: sign into NU VPN, make sure Globus Connect Personal App is running, plug in ethernet cord\nBecause accessing this server is done through a computer, it makes transferring files specific to the computer that the server is mapped to. Typically, you will ask Katie to share the Globus endpoint for this server that is set up through the lab iMac. As long as the server is mapped to the computer (typically lab iMac) and that connection is not interrupted, you should have no problems.\nFrom a laptop or over wifi, transfers of large files are very slow. This is why we map to the server through the iMac. The point of all the steps we outline below is so we can use Globus to transfer files from the smb drive to Discovery.\nTo connect to the smb server, follow these directions to map to the server on a computer this document (typically Katie only)\nSetting up a Globus endpoint for the folder to share (typically Katie only)\nIntitial step if Globus personal endpoint for the computer is not set up: Download and install the Globus Connect Personal App. In Globus web app, click on “Add a personal endpoint” and enter the key in the Desktop app.\nIntial setup if working from a home laptop: Use GlobalProtect to establish a VPN connection (vpn.northeastern.edu) (if you are having trouble establishing the VPN connection on a Mac, check your Security and Permissions settings and give the app permissions, see image). Then you should be able to map to the server.\n\nStep 1: In the Globus Desktop App, then go to Preferences-> Access and click the “+” sign. On a Mac, at the top center click on the bar, click on the name of the computer, and you should see the mapped server there as a volume Volumes/lotterhos. Click on it and add it to the list.\n\nStep 2: In the Globus Web App, go to the endpoint for the computer. Then type Volumes/lotterhos/ in the path. Save it as a bookmark.\nStep 3: Before you can conduct file transfers from a personal endpoint, you need to have a “Globus Plus Account”. Email James Macalino at NU research computing to get added. You will then receive an email."

If your jobs have exceeded those limits, this may have been the cause of job terminations.\nb. On the “lotterhos” partition, you do not have any restrictions on number of submitted jobs, or requested cpus. To submit to the lotterhos partition, simply set the SLURM flag for this partition:\nFor an interactive job (example): srun -p lotterhos --nodes=1 --cpus-per-task=1 --pty --time=24:00:00 /bin/bash\nThis example will allocate a single node with 1 CPU (and –ntasks=1 by default, but alternatively, you can also use this instead:\nsrun -p lotterhos --nodes=1 --ntasks =1 --pty --time=24:00:00 /bin/bash for 24 hours, and flag --pty will set all output to be printed to the screen. /bin/bash is the command to be run for this job, so any bash command after this will be executed.\nIf you run this command, you can type: lscpu to get the hardware info (such as core count).\nFor a batch (background) job, adding the following to your bash script is equivalent:\nIf your shell script looks the same, and the only thing changing is a particular parameter, for example:\nThen you can also take advantage of the job-array structure to submit multiple jobs at a time. Each SLURM job that is defined as array will have several bash variables associated with this that are defined once the job is submitted. The main important variable that can be useful is: $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID For example, if you create a SLURM array job with 10 jobs in the array, then the values $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID will get are: 1,…,10 (each job in the array will be assigned with a number 1-10, and can be distinguished this way). Here, %10 means all 10 jobs are set to run together. Setting %1 means they will run one after another.\nThis setup will run the program on a specific input file based on the $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID  value (input-1,input-2,…,input-10) and will output the results to output file named based on the value of $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID  (output-1,output-2,…,output-10).\nThere is a hard limit of an array size of 1000 that research computing cannot increase.\nIn addition, this kind of code will not work: #SBATCH —array=1001-1951%68 because the array index goes over 1000 (Even though the number of jobs in the array is less than 1000). So if you have more than 1000 simulations, I don’t recommend the array approach."

R code in part c from Workflow parralelization approaches shows an example of how you can capture the run time of a particular job, or a parallel segment by printing out the time difference it takes to calculate a particular part. You can also modify this to calculate the total time it took to run your code. To find the best performance, I would recommend to benchmark the calculations on (for example) 1,24,8,16,32 cores and see if at some point it levels off in terms of run time, this may mean that there would be no benefit to request more cores beyond that. Research Computing can discuss performance testing, just schedule another consultation time.\nb. You can also look at the efficiency and memory usage of your jobs by looking at the completed jobs from your slurm history, by typing: acct -S 2020-08-10 -u albecker Then, selecting a particular job (might be beneficial to have a small script that runs through all jobs, since you had over 100,000 jobs this month, I can help with that too if needed) and using the seff command to extract the efficiency. For example:\nHere, you can see that the CPU efficiency was very high at 99%, but you ended up using less than 1% of the memory you requested (284.50 MB out of 50.00 GB). This information is useful to better allocate and utilize resources in the future.\nc. It is also recommended to perform short testing prior to submit long jobs to the cluster. You can use the “debug”, “express” or the “lotterhos” partition and you can run the job interactively.

But, it is good to leave a couple of cores open for srun tasks.\nIf each task requires 2 CPUS, set --CPUs-per-task=2 (look it up) and set --array=50-151%36 to maximize the resources in the lotterhos partition.\nIF programs can use multiple threads, do benchmarking to determine CPU per task, 1-2 jobs at a time, and do seff on those tasks that completed (see below).

    "title": "69  Parallelization with Array",
    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nBrief review of using the #SBATCH --array slurm argument to restrict the number of jobs running in parallel on Discovery. Arrays seem to be most effective when you have a large number of jobs that all require the same number of resources and the user wants to limit the amount of the computing resource being used at a particular time. This guide follows the same template format from the lotterhos wiki, which reads through and leverages a reference file that contains a number of file names corresponding to files you wish to process. For example, this cod contain a list of raw sequence files (e.g., fq.gz) that you with to perform trimming and qc on.\n\nBreaking down the --array argument\nThe --array argument can take a single integer,1, or a range, 1-32, of integers that the slurm script will iterate through. Following the range of integers you specify the number of these values you wish to process simultaneously using the % operator. For example, if you wish to iterate through the range of integers in batches of 4 you could code: #SBATCH --array=1-32%4\nOther options\n# A job array with array tasks numbered 1, 2, 5, 19, 27.\n#SBATCH --array=1,2,5,19,27\n\n# A job array with array tasks numbered 1, 3, 5 and 7.\n#SBATCH --array=1-7:2\n\n\nUsing the --array argument in your script\nIncluding the above example (#SBATCH --array=1-32%4) in your slurm script will effectively iterate through your slurm script 32 times, by running 4 simultaneous instances (or jobs) of the script at a time on Discovery. However, running the same script with identical parameters (or files) may not be particularly useful. Instead we probably want to run the same script but apply it to a different set of data or use different parameters. At the very least we want to be able to create unique outputs for each iteration!\nConviently, the --array argument creats a unix variable - SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID, which in the case above references the specific integer that corresponds to the particular instances of the script. For example, the first iteration of your slurm script will have SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID=1.\nThis could be leveraged in multiple ways, but one option is using this index to extract specific lines from a reference script. The data on these lines could be anything, but having file names is a particular useful approach if you want to apply your script to multiple files.\nShort illustration\nVARNAME=`sed \"${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}q;d\" path/to/reference/reference.txt`\n\nfile1 = path/to/data/${VARNAME}\n\necho '${file1}'\nExample of reference file:\ndatafile1.csv\ndatafile2.csv\ndatafile3.csv\nExample output in .out file\ndatafile1.csv\ndatafile2.csv\ndatafile3.csv\n\n\nCalculations\nThe lotterhos partition has 2 nodes, 36 cores per node, and 5GB per core. A job that only uses a single cpu should not take up more than 5GB of memory.\nHere is an example of an array that runs 72 jobs at a time, each job runs on one core. In the remaining script, not shown, is code that reads the input parameters from a file that has 1000 lines (the first line is the header, and each line after that has parameters). Hence, the array starts on line 2 and goes to line 1000. Unless the program is able to cross-talk among nodes (most do not have the architecture to do that), then nodes should always be set to 1. However, this script will run arrays across both lotterhos nodes (the nodes=1 just indicates that each task will use one node).\n#SBATCH --partition=lotterhos\n#SBATCH --mem=5GB\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --array=2-1000%70\n1000 is the upper limit that can be requested by the “array” command. It’s also good to keep the total number of jobs submitted at a time capped at 70, so that a couple of cores are left open for srun\nBelow is an example of a job that calls a program that can use multiple cpus. If 32 cpus are requested, then 32 cpus * 5GB/cpu = 160GB can be also requested for memory. Unless the program is able to cross-talk among nodes (most do not have the architecture to do that), then nodes should always be set to 1. y Since there are only 2 nodes, each with 36 cpus, then we can only run 2 jobs at a time and stay within the bounds of the architecture. Hence thearray=2-1000%2 argument\n#SBATCH --partition=lotterhos\n#SBATCH --mem=160GB\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=32\n#SBATCH --array=2-1000%2\n\n\nPratical example\nScript performs bismark mapping, bismark on list of files based on the file names in a reference text file, sample_files.txt.
