# Qubit dsDNA Quantification

The Qubit machine is located on the post-PCR (blue tape) lab bench. It can run broad range (BR) or high-sensitivity (HS) assays to quantify DNA. DNA concentration outputs are typically in ng/uL.

## Picking the Right Qubit Assay

|                                   | **BR**                                         | **HS**                                              |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Concentration detection range** | 0.2-2000 ng/uL                                 | 0.005-120 ng/uL                                     |
| **DNA mass detection range**      | 4-2000 ng                                      | 0.1-120 ng                                          |
| **Best accuracy**                 | With higher range samples                      | With lower range samples                            |
| **Ideal use**                     | Unsure of DNA concentrations                   | Know low DNA concentrations                         |
