## Required Trainings to Work In Molecular Lab
* Laboratory Safety Program Orientation - See Ryan Hill (Facilities Manager) for setting this up
* Fundamentals of Laboratory Safety - See Ryan Hill (Facilities Manager) for setting this up
* Autoclave Training - See Technicians in Ocean Genome Legacy for training
* Shared Equipment Training - See Technicians in Ocean Genome Legacy for training
* Layout and Tour/Labelling of the Lotterhos Lab - See current Grad Student (Sara Schaal) or Lab Manager (Thais Bittar)

## Molecular Lab Layout & Rules
* Benches, squirt bottles, markers & pipettes have color coded tapes to outline where and with which pipettes specific work is done. 
  * Yellow tape indicates pre-PCR molecular work.
  * Light Blue tape indicates Post-PCR molecular work.
  * Orange tape indicates RNA molecular work and is all done in the UV hood.
  * No colored tape indicates "dirty" benches for phones, computers, lab notebooks, etc.
  * Exceptions to these strict rules are the multichannel pipettes and the magnetic plate because we only have one of each.

* Tip boxes whenever a box is taken off the shelf to be used in the post-PCR area that box stays in that area and 
does not get placed back on the shelf. All boxes on the shelf if opened can only be used on the pre-PCR bench. 

* All benches that will be used for your molecular work for the day should be cleaned with 10% bleach then 70% ethanol. 
You should also do this after your done working for the day.

* If using the UV hood for RNA work, all supplies that will be used for said work need to be placed in the UV hood and then light
should be turned on for 1 hour to sterilize everything. DO NOT PUT YOUR SAMPLES IN THE UV HOOD WHEN THE LIGHT IS ON! 

* Gloves should be used when touching anything on all molecular benches, shelves above those benches (except the first shelf labeled with pink tape),fridge, -20oC freezer.
  * NO GLOVES IN HALLS OR TOUCHING DOOR HANDLES. Can have one glove on but the other hand free to open doors.
  * Keyboards in shared molecular space have labels for whether you should operate with or without gloves. Pay attention to these labels.

* Filtered tips are used for all molecular work (as budget allows). Fisherbrand tips are to be used ONLY ONLY ONLY with the multichannel pipettes.

* -80oC freezer is linked to a alarm system to alert us if it goes below -70oC. If you have to take samples/reagents out or in please work quickly
and efficiently to ensure it does not drop below that temperature. If you need to do a lot of reorganizing the -80, take breaks to allow the temperature
to come back down to ~ -80oC.

* The layout of the -80oC freezer can be found https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12TA0x9hPe6B8G34A2ID93ebjxdaGcEiMHAAajCyuQqo/edit#gid=0 
please see current Grad Student (Sara Schaal or Alan Downey-Wall) to get training on how to fill out this document.

* -20oC freezer has a general layout with the top shelf for main stocks, second shelf aliquots of kits and other reagents, 
third shelf is for DNA/RNA extractions, fourth shelf for tissue samples for DNA/RNA extraction. 



## Working in the Molecular Lab

* If you need an aliquot of anything, see current lab manager (Thais Bittar). Main stocks of primers and adapters are in the -80oC
and should ONLY ONLY ONLY be handled by the lab manager.

  * Label your aliquot clearly with a date and keep track of which aliquot you use for a given days protocol. This is to ensure that
  if you get DNA in your negative control you can track which aliquots you need to test for contamination. ** THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT **

* Always use a negative control in all steps from extraction, to quantification and to library prep.

* Aliquots of positive controls for multiple species are kept in the -80oC freezer. See lab manager for aliquot. Use if you have work that
is failing and you want to make sure its not the samples themselves.

* ADD BUFFER AND FREEZER ID INFO FOR SAMPLES
* -20oC for brief use of RNA -80oC for long term storage
