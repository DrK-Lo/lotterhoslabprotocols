    "text": "Vince Buffalo’s Bioinformatic Data Skills is a great book to build skills. Katie has a set of great readings for learning, contact her for more info.\n\n\n\nhttps://radcamp.github.io/NYC2019/RADCamp-PartII-Day1-AM.html\nhttps://github.com/dereneaton/ipyrad/blob/master/newdocs/assembly_guidelines.rst\nhttp://www.popgen.dk/software/index.php/PCAngsd handle genotype likelihoods\n\n\n\nWhat is a VCF? https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf\nKatie also has some lectures on VCF files.\n\n\nWhen getting started, it’s best to filter for relatedness and linkage disequilibrium, so that you have a quasi-independent set of individuals and SNPs.\nCheck related individuals with vcf using vcftools (–relatedness)\nFilter the VCF file. Use VCF tools to do this: http://vcftools.sourceforge.net/\n\nfor minor alleles < 0.05 (if you have a lot of SNPs, or 0.01 if you don’t have a lot of SNPs)\nfor missing data at SNPs (keep SNPs in at least X% of individuals in all dataset)\nfor missing data at population level (keeps SNPs with calls in X% or higher of individuals per population)\nfor individuals with low SNP count (keep individuals with higher than X% of SNPs called)\nDepending on the context, X% might be 80% or might be 100%\n\nTo use the bigsnpr R package, you will have to change your data from the VCF format to a genotype matrix with 0/1/2 counts of the alternate allele. Transform from vcf to (plink to) raw. See the first steps in this tutorial.\nThe presence of LD can bias principal components. This paper explains the problem. Read about filtering for LD with pruning and clumping\nFilter the raw data using snp_autoSVD (it’s at the end of the tutorial) This tutorial also teaches you how to do a PCA.\n\n\n\nFor Structure use LEA program sNMF package vcf input in R. (http://membres-timc.imag.fr/Olivier.Francois/LEA/tutorial.htm)\n\n\n\nBefore you run an RDA and do some of the things in these tutorials, talk to Dr. L about your plan. Outlier SNP analysis with RDA have a lot of false positives, but the individual scores are very useful.\nhttps://popgen.nescent.org/2018-03-27_RDA_GEA.html\nhttps://github.com/laurabenestan/RDA_outlier\nKatie also has some RDA code on simulations and oyster data.\n\n\n\nGenotype-phenotype association: LFMM2. Read the paper lfmm2 and LEA3\nLFMM2 functions\nLEA installation Check with Katie this is correct before running\n\n\n\nMarine Omics working group"
