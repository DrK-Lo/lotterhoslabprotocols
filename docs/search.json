If everything is correct go to ‘Return Cart to Purchasing Application’\nClick ‘Submit’. You will return to myMarketplace\nFrom here, choose the index (the budget code, depending on the project), the account code (typically Scientific Supplies), and how much to cover with this budget code (typically 100%)\nClick ‘Send to Approval’ DO NOT FORGET STEPS BELOW\nOnce you receive a confirmation e-mail with the receipt of the purchase forward it to the Business and Operations Manager (currently Liz Magee) and David Dawson. CC Katie on the e-mail\nIn the body of the e-mail put the index number it was charged to\nDownload PDF of the receipt, rename to date_company_item (e.g. 20180505_Fisher_Gloves) and add it to the Dropbox Folder : LotterhosLab/orders and receipts Katie will need these receipts to do budgets at the end of the month\n\n\n\n\nSometimes orders will have to be placed outside these companies. Many sites will have a lab login (get from Katie), if there isn’t one, you’ll create one Make sure the account is tax-free; you can get the tax numbers from Katie to set this up\nTo order from external companies:\n\nLogin with lab login\nPlace order, making sure no tax is applied (it’s hard to get reimbursed)\nPay with American Express card\nIf using your e-mail, and you receive receipt, rename PDF with same convention as above and add to Dropbox\nTypically lab login will be through Katie’s e-mail; confirm with Katie that she has received the receipt"

If the temperature reaches -65C, wait until it gets back up to -75C before you load more samples. It puts a lot of stress on the freezer.\n\n\n\n\nWe need to contact Dennis Todd to request a 24hr+ freezer alarm shutoff.\n\n\n\n\n\nCryoCube-F570 operating manual\n\n\n1) Find a backup freezer for the samples and confirm that there’s enough space for all contents of our freezer; check the dimensions of the available shelves in the backup freezer to see if it is the same as ours (ideally, transfer whole racks to the equivalent shelf & rack position on the backup freezer to save time and avoid messing up the inventory).\n2) Find help - defrosting can be done by one person, but having a second pair of hands is very helpful and strongly recommended.\n3) Familiarize yourself with the protocol to disable freezer alarms (see above), with the materials that need to be on hand to defrost & clean the freezer and the overall protocol/timeline described below.\n\n\n\n4) Before you begin, double-check that the backup freezer(s)’ alarm was disabled (see above instructions); request that our alarm is disabled remotely for 24h by emailing Dennis Todd @ northeastern; gather:\n\nfreezer mittens\nlab cart\na mop or large towel\n‘wet floor’ sign\na cooler or large styrofoam box for lose boxes/bags\na bucket to collect water\nclean cloths to wipe the freezer\n\n5) WEARING FREEZER MITTENS, transfer whole racks to the backup freezer: place all 5 racks from one shelf on our lab cart; roll the cart to the backup freezer and place them on the equivalent shelf and in the same order as they were on our freezer. Do this one shelf at the time until the freezer is empty.\n\ntransfer racks in and out of freezers carefully but quickly to minimize temp rising - note that the drawers slide open, so keep the racks horizontal; monitor both freezer’s temp as you transfer - shouldn’t rise above -65oC.\n\n6) Once empty:\n\nput up a “wet floor” sign,\nclose the CO2 cylinder valve,\nswitch off the local alarm box located on top of the freezer,\nunlock the switch locking plate (front-bottom-right side of the freezer) and switch off the battery (top) and the main (bottom) switches,\nunplug the freezer from the wall,\nopen all doors and let the freezer defrost, use a bucket to catch water dripping from the doors, use a mop to dry up the puddles.\n\n7) Once defrosted: wipe the whole interior of the freezer, the inner and outer doors and the seal using clean microfiber cloths (under the lab sink) until completely dry.\n8) Reverse to bring freezer back up: close all doors, plug freezer back up, switch on main switch/battery switch and lock up the locking plate, switch on alarm box up on top of the freezer. Monitor temperature to ensure that it is appropriately decreasing all the way to -80oC.\n\nduring this stage, the freezer alarm may go off (not the alarms associated with the remote system), just mute it using the door pannel keys.\n\n\n\n\n9) Disable our freezer alarm for 1h (instructions above). Set a timer for yourself for 55 min because you might need to extend alarm cancellation. Check with the host lab on whether the alarm on the backup freezer needs to be disabled.\n10) WEARING FREEZER MITTENS transfer freezer racks back and ensure they are placed back on the freezer position (shelf & row) where they before - so it continues to match the freezer database. Leave one or two empty racks in the freezer for new boxes. Monitor the temperature of both freezers during retrieval to ensure it does not raise above 65oC.\n11) If you need to take a break to allow the temperature to drop, remember to extend the alarm cancellation for another hour.\n12) Once all samples are back, wait around and make sure that the freezer temp drops down to -80oC.\n\n\n\nOctober 2021 defrost (Thais, Sara and Alan):\n\nOGL was able to hold our samples (MUST coordinate with OGL personnel ahead of time); OGL’s freezers was completely empty, and shelves have the same dimensions as ours (plus an extra shelf); their freezer was not hooked up to an alarme system at the time.\nWe were able to transfer all racks to the equivalent positions into the backup freezer (one shelf at the time) without needing to wait too long for the temperature to stabilize. Because the backup freezer was empty, the temp rose to -58oC when we transferred the first shelf/5 racks.\nOur freezer was defrosted, cleaned/dried and turned back on within 2 hours.\nTransfer-defrost-cleaning took from 11am to 2pm.\nTemp down to -80oC within another 2-3 hours (all done by 5pm).\nThe CO2 valve was reopened the following day.\nThe following week, we transferred the racks back. Temp went up to 65oC after 3 shelves were tranferred so we took 1h break, then tranferred the remaining racks and samples.\nTook about 2h for the temp to go back down to -80oC (freezer alarm went off once).\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintenance has been done with: https://alertscientific.com/"

Because we are not on the main campus, Ryan Hill (MSC facilities) does all of our waste pickup so you must email him to ask him to come to the lab for that specific purpose; don’t hesitate to follow up if he hasn’t responded or you see that waste has not been collected within a day or 2. For liquid waste, let him know specifically which containers to pickup (for example, put all containers to be picke up in a separate tray inside the Satelite Accumulation Area and leave a note on the tray saying - “please pickup all 3 bottles inside this tray”). For mayo jars or sharps container, I usually place them on the bench right across from the lab door, inside a cardboard box if possible, with a note as well."

Use VCF tools to do this: http://vcftools.sourceforge.net/\n\nfor minor alleles < 0.05 (if you have a lot of SNPs, or 0.01 if you don’t have a lot of SNPs)\nfor missing data at SNPs (keep SNPs in at least X% of individuals in all dataset)\nfor missing data at population level (keeps SNPs with calls in X% or higher of individuals per population)\nfor individuals with low SNP count (keep individuals with higher than X% of SNPs called)\nDepending on the context, X% might be 80% or might be 100%\n\nTo use the bigsnpr R package, you will have to change your data from the VCF format to a genotype matrix with 0/1/2 counts of the alternate allele. Transform from vcf to (plink to) raw. See the first steps in this tutorial.\nThe presence of LD can bias principal components. This paper explains the problem. Read about filtering for LD with pruning and clumping\nFilter the raw data using snp_autoSVD (it’s at the end of the tutorial) This tutorial also teaches you how to do a PCA.\n\n\n\nFor Structure use LEA program sNMF package vcf input in R.

Autoclaving should be performed on the following items:\n\nContainers used while working with microorganisms\nGlassware used to store food for experimental organisms\nBiohazard waste containers\nPipette tip boxes\n\n\n\n\n\nReview or take the autoclave training on the Northeastern Environmental Health and Safety website.\nIt is mandatory to scheudle a 20 minute in-person training with Rosie Falco Poulin (r.falco@northeastern.edu) at the MSC to follow up on the online course.\nAlways unscrew jars or vials as the high pressure may cause them to explode if tightened.\n\n\n\n\n\nFill out autoclave sign up in binder\nMake sure all knobs are at zero\nLoad samples onto metal sheet inside the autoclave\nReset red arm to zero (top gauge). This arm keeps track of temperature maximum during the run\nTurn ON autoclave with green switch\nTurn bottom knob to fill water - wait until water reaches the front of the groove (might already have water in it)\nSwitch knob to sterilize\nSeal the door by turning clockwise (not too tight)\nLook on the chart:\n\ndetermine what you are autoclaving (wrapped vs unwrapped)\nSet temperature to the desired setting\nExample: Unwrapped = 3850 model, cold start, 32 min, 134 degrees\n\nSet timer (NOTE: Setting timer starts the run)\nCome back 52 minutes later (32 in autoclave + 20 to depressurize) - If the red gauge reads lower than your desired temperature, it didn’t get hot enough (due to too much water or too much glassware). Run it again, if needed, for slightly longer (~40 mins) and make sure it reaches the appropriate temperature (indicated by red arm)\nCrack open door to boil off water\nOPTIONAL: Set bottom knob to extra dry (if there is still a lot of moisture\nRun for 20-30 min on dry\nOtherwise, set knobs back to zero and turn off autoclave\nMake sure the red arm is back to 0"

All boxes on the shelf if opened can only be used on the pre-PCR bench.\nAll benches that will be used for your molecular work for the day should be cleaned with 10% bleach then 70% ethanol. You should also do this after your done working for the day.\nIf using the UV hood for RNA work, all supplies that will be used for said work need to be placed in the UV hood and then light should be turned on for 1 hour to sterilize everything. DO NOT PUT YOUR SAMPLES IN THE UV HOOD WHEN THE LIGHT IS ON!\nGloves should be used when touching anything on all molecular benches, shelves above those benches (except the first shelf labeled with pink tape),fridge, -20oC freezer.\n\nNO GLOVES IN HALLS OR TOUCHING DOOR HANDLES. Can have one glove on but the other hand free to open doors.\nKeyboards in shared molecular space have labels for whether you should operate with or without gloves. Pay attention to these labels.\n\nFiltered tips are used for all molecular work (as budget allows). Fisherbrand tips are to be used ONLY ONLY ONLY with the multichannel pipettes.\n-80oC freezer is linked to a alarm system to alert us if it goes below -70oC. If you have to take samples/reagents out or in please work quickly and efficiently to ensure it does not drop below that temperature. If you need to do a lot of reorganizing the -80, take breaks to allow the temperature to come back down to ~ -80oC.\nThe layout of the -80oC freezer can be found https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12TA0x9hPe6B8G34A2ID93ebjxdaGcEiMHAAajCyuQqo/edit#gid=0 please see current Grad Student (Sara Schaal or Alan Downey-Wall) to get training on how to fill out this document.\n-20oC freezer has a general layout with the top shelf for main stocks, second shelf aliquots of kits and other reagents, third shelf is for DNA/RNA extractions, fourth shelf for tissue samples for DNA/RNA extraction.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you need an aliquot of anything, see current lab manager (Thais Bittar). Main stocks of primers and adapters are in the -80oC and should ONLY ONLY ONLY be handled by the lab manager.\n\nLabel your aliquot clearly with a date and keep track of which aliquot you use for a given days protocol. This is to ensure that if you get DNA in your negative control you can track which aliquots you need to test for contamination. ** THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT **\n\nAlways use a negative control in all steps from extraction, to quantification and to library prep.\nAliquots of positive controls for multiple species are kept in the -80oC freezer. See lab manager for aliquot. Use if you have work that is failing and you want to make sure its not the samples themselves.\nADD BUFFER AND FREEZER ID INFO FOR SAMPLES\n-20oC for brief use of RNA -80oC for long term storage"

Lines and legend in this grid can be edited for size, color, etc.\nShow Scale: displays a calibrated (remember to double-check the zoom) scale that can be edited (font, color, etc).\nAnnotations and Measurements (View > Analysis Controls): this is a good window to have open and docked on the right-side panel. Many resources to measure the image/sample, all calibrated (remember to check zoom). A table with measurements is automatically created and can be exported as an excel file.\nCapture and store: if you need to take multiple pictures and want them automatically assigned a given file name. Choose file name under ‘Prefix’ and photos will be saved sequentially 001, 002, etc.\nManual large image (Acquire > Manual large image): will compose an image of an object larger than the field of view. Turn off auto-shading (‘on’ is the default). Move the object around in any direction and snap a photo as you place different parts of the object in focus. The software will stich the frames together and create a photo of the larger object."

    "text": "Chemicals (including kits) purchased by any lab member, for any purpose, and stored in one of our labs (Edwards bldg and bunker lab) MUST be barcoded and added to our chemical inventory which is hosted in the BioRAFT platform.\n\nThis is done at the container/individual kit level (i.e., not at the chemical substance or class level) - for example, if we have 3 bottles of ethanol in the inventory and buy a new one, that individual new bottle must be assigned its own barcode and added to the inventory.\n\n\n\nAlways place the label where it is easier to see (i.e., not on the bottom of the container, where you’d have to lift the bottle to find it). I typically place it right above the main label.\n\n\n\n\nGo to the lab’s BioRAFT page: Lotterhos Lab > Lab Profile\nClick on the ChemTracker tab > Add inventory\nSearch chemical/kit by name, name or CAS number1\nFill out all required fields\nUnique container ID is where you enter the unique barcode ID\nClick Submit\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove the barcode label and discard it in the trash (i.e., don’t stick it to any other surface and don’t reuse it for another chemical).\nGo to the lab’s BioRAFT page: Lotterhos Lab > Lab Profile\nClick on the ChemTracker tab > Chem Tracker\nAt the bottom of the page, scroll right until you find the “Container ID” and the “Remove” columns\nClick “Remove” and confirm “Remove” to exclude the entry from the inventory.\nRinse and deface the bottle, then discard or reuse to store chemical waste.\n\nDiscard a defaced bottle: label the bottle using an “empty container” label.\nReuse a defaced bottle: label the bottle with a “empty container” label until you start using it for waste and replace it with a “Chemical Waste Label” once you star using it for waste.\n\n\nGo to Chem Tracker (Lotterhos Lab > Lab Profile > ChemTracker tab > ChemTracker) to View and/or Edit the inventory; you can also export the inventory to an excel spreadsheet if you need to sort or print the full list - this is useful when doing self-inspections and inventory checks.\n\nCAS registry numbers are unique, unmistakable identifiers for chemical substances. A CAS Registry Number itself has no inherent chemical significance but provides an unambiguous way to identify a chemical substance or molecular structure when there are many possible systematic, generic, proprietary or trivial names. CAS Registry Numbers are used in many other public and private databases as well as chemical inventory listings and, of course, are included in all CAS-produced databases. ↩︎"
