## General tips

With next generation sequencing, it is important to consider all sources of possible contamination when collecting samples. It is also important to consider the study question. For example, best results for DNA extraction will come from flash-frozen DNA. For DNA methylation and bisulfite sequencing, flash-frozen DNA is also the standard but DNA stored in EtOH can also be used, as long as it hasn't been for a long time. Alternatively, samples can be collected in 'OGLFix' fixative buffer, which does not require special or hazardous designation for shipping.

Some tips:

* All centrifuge tubes used to store tissues should be sterilized and prepared before going out. In general, it is best practice to have tubes organized in a box, with at least 2 labels on each tube (in case one falls off). We have a special barcode label printer (with freezer-proof labels) that can be used. 

* Use a sterilized surface if possible. Sterilize surface with 10% bleach, UV light, or use sterile plastic weigh boats.

* Use sterilized blades or sterilize the blade between samples. A blade can be cleaned with 70% EtOH and sterilized with a flame to burn off the access EtOH. Be sure to get all bits of tissue off the blade. Otherwise, use sterile blades and switch the blade between samples.

### 'OGLFix' fixative buffer

Contact the OGL technicians to request an aliquot of 'OGLFix' fixative buffer with 2 days of notice. You will need 1 mL per sample, so calculate the volume needed accordingly, and provide OGL with an autoclaved glass jar of appropriate volume. This buffer can be kept at room temperature.

Use autoclaved sample containers, i.e., 2-mL microcentrifuge tubes (autoclave tubes and caps separately).

Label the autoclaved tubes and pipette 1 mL of 'OGLFix' into each tube.

Place a piece of tissue inside the tube - the volume of 'OGLFix' should be at least 5 times the volume of solid tissue.

### Tips for flash freezing in liquid N2

We use Fisher cryovials (#10-500-26), although note that they are really not designed to put into liquid N2. They work well for storage in liquid N2 and then transfer to the -80C.

### Tips for EtOH

Regular grade 95% ethanol works well for DNA preservation. Make sure the EtOH can permeate the tissues.
