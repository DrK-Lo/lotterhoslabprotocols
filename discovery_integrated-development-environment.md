# What are VS Code and PyCharm?

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) are both Integrated Developement Environments, or IDEs. You've probably worked with an IDE, RStudio is an IDE. Ultimately the purpose of an IDE is to make coding easier. Some of the most basic features of IDEs are syntax highlighting and autocompletion capabilities, but they can also do a lot more than that - like displaying hover-over metadata (eg displaying a function's documentation when hovering over code), jumping to the part of the file where a function is defined/used, showing where an error will occur, among others. While PyCharm is specifically built for python (but see other IDEs from [jet brains](https://www.jetbrains.com)), VS Code supports hundreds of coding languages.

Both PyCharm and VS Code have free professional versions for students and academics - see eg here for [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students). I won't say much more about the purposes and cool features of these IDEs, for that it would be good to google, use the intro/how-to resources from each program's page, or better yet open one up and explore.

The purpose of this post is to show how to set up VS Code and PyCharm to connect to NEU's Discovery cluster.
