## Background
PicoGreen dsDNA Quantitation Reagent is an ultra-sensitive fluorescent nucleic acid stain for quantitating double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in molecular biological procedures such as cDNA synthesis for library production and DNA fragment purification for subcloning, as well as diagnostic applications, such as quantitating DNA amplification products and primer extension assays. 
The most commonly used technique for measuring nucleic acid concentration is the determination of absorbance at 260 nm (A260).

## Equipment & Reagents
* flat bottom black Costar 96-well plate (Fisher Cat #: 07-200-627) (FIND OUT IF AUTOCLAVE SAFE)
* two - 15 mL Falcon tubes
* samples diluted to appropriate concentration to be read on the plate reader
* 20X TE Buffer (comes with PicoGreen Kit)
* PicoGreen Dye (comes with PicoGreen Kit)
* DNA Ladder 100 ug/mL (comes with PicoGreen Kit)

## Important Notes 
* Plate reader can read samples between 25 pg/mL - 1,000 ng/mL (or 0.000025 - 1 ng/uL). To be conservative we make the highest concentration for our ladder 500 ng/mL.
* Samples should be diluted to be read within this range. For example, typical quants for Atlantic cod DNA extractions using a spin column plate is between 10 - 200 ng/uL (or .01 to .2). Therefore, you should do a 
* PicoGreen dye is a solid when stored at 4C and therefore, needs to come to room temperature before use. Take out the kit and leave on the counter before starting protocol to ensure it becomes a liquid. Can pipette TE and samples while it is coming to room temp.
* The first column of your plate needs to be saved for the ladder standards. Therefore if you are using 6 standards as recommended in this protocol, the most samples you could run on a plate is 90.

## Protocol
* Dilute your 20X TE to 1X TE by pipetting 9.5 mL of Molecular Grade H2O and 0.5 mL of 20X TE into a 15mL falcon tube. This solution is stable long term so if you will be running a lot of samples make two falcon tubes worth to have on hand. This will be enough for a full plate of samples. 
* Create your ladder standards using Table 1. The stock ladder is at 100 ug/mL. So for example, to make Dilution 1 at 2 ug/mL, combine 1 uL of stock ladder with 49 uL of 1X TE.
* Pipette 49 uL of 1X TE in all sample wells and the appropriate volume of 1X TE into each standard well according to Table 2.
* Add 1 uL of sample to each of the sample wells and the appropriate amount of each ladder to the standard wells. 
* At this point your PicoGreen should be at room temperature. Create your Diluted PicoGreen and use Equation 1 to determine how much stock PicoGreen you need for the number of samples/standards you are running. Then use that value to calculate the amount of 1X TE this should be added to for a 200 times dilution using Equation 2. Each well will get 50 uL of 200 times diluted PicoGreen. 

### Equation 1 
(1.1 * (50 uL diluted PicoGreen * (#samples + #standards))/200 = vol of Stock PicoGreen 

### Equation 2 
199 * vol of Stock PicoGreen = vol of 1x TE
