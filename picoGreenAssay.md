## Background
PicoGreen dsDNA Quantitation Reagent is an ultra-sensitive fluorescent nucleic acid stain for quantitating double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in molecular biological procedures such as cDNA synthesis for library production and DNA fragment purification for subcloning, as well as diagnostic applications, such as quantitating DNA amplification products and primer extension assays. 
The most commonly used technique for measuring nucleic acid concentration is the determination of absorbance at 260 nm (A260).

## Equipment & Reagents
flat bottom black Costar 96-well plate (Fisher Cat #: 07-200-627) (FIND OUT IF AUTOCLAVE SAFE)
two - 15 mL Falcon tubes
samples diluted to appropriate concentration to be read on the plate reader

## Important Notes 
Plate reader can read samples between 25 pg/mL - 1,000 ng/mL (or 0.000025 - 1 ng/uL). To be conservative we make the highest concentration for our ladder 500 ng/mL.
Samples should be diluted to be read within this range. For example, typical quants for Atlantic cod DNA extractions using a spin column plate is between 
10 - 200 ng/uL (or .01 to .2). Therefore, you should do a
