# Changing Gonad Buffer

Protocol for changing the ethanol out of gonad tissue vials.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are switching to a 95Etoh-PureNoAdditives buffer.
See [types of ethanol page](https://github.com/DrK-Lo/lotterhoslabprotocols/blob/3689d797871137dc6ae6eedd4959b8365b184d0c/molecprot_etoh) to understand why we are changing the ethanol out of gonad vials.

## Steps for changing ethanol out of gonad tissue vials

1. Centrigue the vial for 2 minutes at full speed
2. Use a pipette to suck up the 95MGetoh ethanol buffer

**Note**: Make sure to not suck up any tissue!

3. Add the 95Etoh-PureNoAdditives ethanol buffer

## Exceptions

### For cryovials that do not fit in the certifuge

1. Transfer the tissue into a o-ring with the label for long term storage

### For vials with too much gonad and not enough ethanol (over 1:5 ratio)

1. Transfer the tissue in these to a o-ring with the label for long term storage
