# Oyster Phenotypic Data Gathering 

[Edit this page](https://github.com/DrK-Lo/lotterhoslabprotocols/edit/main/field_oystersampling.qmd)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Materials ** {.unnumbered}

-   Trays 

-   Shucking knife 

-   Weighing scale 

-   Foil tin boats (1/ oyster)

-   Mini Whirl-Paks (1/ oyster)

-   Brown paper bags (1/ population) 

## Step 1: Pre-Dry 

1. Defrost oysters on the counter 
    - new: deforst overnight in 4C animal fridge

* these instructions are for each oyster, work through each bag one at a time. Make sure to randomize which bags are processed on which day and avoid processing all bags from the same population (ex. FL-4, FL-5, and FL-6) all on one day to avoid batch effects * 

2. Label tins for each oyster to be processed 
    - open the Phenotyping Bags page in the app, click "add related phenotyping" - this will auto-generate a unique ID for the oyster. Label 1-2 tin weigh boats (if you can fit both          the tissue and the shell in one boat that is fine, but if the oyster is larger you will likely need two boats). 

3. Place the oyster in the tin

4. Use calipers to measure the length and width of the oyster 

5. Shuck oyster open, place the shell in one tins, scrape out tissue onto a paper towel to soak up any excess liquid

6. Place an empty tin boat on the scale and zero it; then scrape oyster tissue onto the boat and record wet tissue weight (2 decimal points). Once recorded, scrape the tissue into the tin with the shell if space, or into a new labeled tin if more space is needed 

    -   keep all tins in orderly rows on trays
    -   shell and tissue can share a tin as long as they don't touch 

7. Once wet tissue weight is recorded, place trays into a drying oven at 55 C for ~ 20 hours (time point 1), and up to 60 hours (time point 3) 

    -   The temperature and length depend on the size of the oyster - these settings worked for oysters with wet tissue weight within the range of 0.05 - 3.00 g 
    -   New: place in drying oven at 60 C on Friday at 5pm. On Monday morning, remove from dryer once fully dried  (~65 hours drying period) 

## During Dry 

1. Pre-label all paper bags needed to store the dry oyster shells. Use the corresponding vial ID generated by the app during step 1

## Step 2: After Dry 

1. Remove trays from drying oven; tissue should be dehydrated and stiff but not burnt to a crisp

2. Place an empty tin on the scale - zero it - then place the oyster shell in the tin and record the weight 

3. Place weighed shell into corresponding labeled paper bag   

4. Zero the scale with an empty tin on it again, then scrape the dry tissue into it, record the dry tissue weight 
    -  if tissue is burnt on, can weigh the tin with the tissue without zeroing the tin first, then scrape off the burnt tissue as much as posisble, weigh the tin, and subtract the            difference

5. Dispose of tissue. Organize shell bags and store in bunker.
