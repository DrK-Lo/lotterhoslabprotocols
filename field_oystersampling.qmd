# Oyster Phenotypic Data Gathering 

[Edit this page](https://github.com/DrK-Lo/lotterhoslabprotocols/edit/main/field_oystersampling.qmd)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Materials ** {.unnumbered}

-   Trays 

-   Shucking knife 

-   Weighing scale 

-   Foil tin boats (1/ oyster)

-   Mini Whirl-Paks (1/ oyster)

-   Brown paper bags (1/ population) 

## Step 1: Pre-Dry 

1. Defrost oysters on the counter 
    - new: deforst overnight in 4C animal fridge

2. Label tins for each oyster to be processed 
    - use label generated by the app, it will add a unique ID number to the end of the BagID for individual-level data 

3. Place an oyster in each tin

4. Use calipers to measure the length and width of each oyster 

5. Shuck oysters open, leave shells in the tins, scrape out tissue onto paper towels 

6. Place an empty tin boat on the scale and zero it; then scrape oyster tissue onto the boat and record wet tissue weight. Once recorded, scrape tissue into the tin with the shell if space, into a new labeled tin if more space is needed 

    -   keep all tins in orderly rows on trays

7. Once all wet tissue weight is recorded, place trays into a drying oven at 55 C for ~ 20 hours 

    -   The temperature and length depend on the size of the oyster - these settings worked for oysters with wet tissue weight within the range of 0.05 - 3.00 g 
    -   New: place in drying oven at 60 C on Friday at 5pm. Check on Monday and remove from dryer once fully dried (~60 hours) 

## During Dry 

1. Pre-label all paper bags needed to store the dry oyster shells. Use the corresponding vial ID generated by the app during step 1

## Step 2: After Dry 

1. Remove trays from drying oven; tissue should be dehydrated and stiff but not burnt to a crisp

2. Place an empty tin on the scale - zero it - then place the oyster shell in the tin and record the weight 

3. Place weighed shell into corresponding labeled paper bag   

4. Zero the scale with an empty tin on it again, then scrape the dry tissue into it, record the dry tissue weight 
    -  if tissue is burnt on, can weigh the tin with the tissue without zeroing the tin first, then scrape off the burnt tissue as much as posisble, weigh the tin, and subtract the            difference

5. Dispose of tissue. Organize shell bags and store in bunker.
