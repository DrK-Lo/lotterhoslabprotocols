Attended by Elisabeth Leung

Led by Emma Gubler (College of Science Safety Officer)
- e.gubler@northeastern.edu
    - Reach out for high level safety issues or inter-college issue

New OARS lab safety personnel:
- Conor Donovan
- Collin Burkhard

Boston Fire Department Inspections:

What is WBE: A fire code consultant firm that NEU contracts with
- They help us prepare for the BFD inspections
- Have been doing mock inspections

Key findings:
- Inaccurate Chemical Inventory
    - BFD can pull bioraft inventory and compare 1-to-1 about what is in the lab
    - They will know if something is not accounted for 
    - Would rather report more of a chemical than less 
    - Underreporting flammables should be avoided
- Improper Chemical Storage
    - Commingling incomparable chemicals 
        - In the same cabinet without secondary containers
    - DO not store alphabetically
    - Use EPA chemical compatibility chart to help organize chemicals
    - Can reach out to Conor and Colin about storage questions
- Inaccurate NFPA sign
    - NFPA diamond not matching chemical inventory
    - Liquid nitrogen means an automatic 3 in health 

Inspections are facilities responsibility - slowing moving to ECO
- Reach out to OARS for the eyewash 
- 
Emergency Documentation Guidance:
- EAP
    - Print and keep copy in lab
- CHP & SDS
    - Maintain Digital copies offline
    - If you can show you are working towards compliance and downloading over time, that is fine (do it in a reasonable amount of time)
- NFPA
    - Number on the NFPA must be a 24 hour emergency number required 
    - If you don’t want to put personal number on the sign work around: put your teams number on the door - download the teams app

SAA Do’s and Don’ts:
DO: 
- Post SAA signage directly above the area
- Place all waste containers in secondary containers
- Place incompatible wastes in separate secondary containers
- Submit waste pick ups as needed

DONT:
- Place SAAs near sinkers or paths of egress
- Store chemicals in a hood/cabinet near SAA without secondary containment
- Store incompatible wastes in the same secondary container
- Not do any of the thing in the “Do” column!

OARS segment: 
Led by Conor Donovan and Collin Burkhard

OARS Projects:
Spill Kits
- OARS office has ordered spill kits of all labs
- Will send memo on how to pick up spill kits once they arrive
- Can’t resupply - labs must resupply themselves 
Chemical Storage
- Make sure they are stored compatibly
New Hazardous Waste Labels
- Redesigned to make it easier to understand the labels and to fill them out easier
- Can still use old labels, will slowly faze in new ones 
New SAA Signs
- Will be located on OARS website
- Don’t have to be green
- Please double check labels to make sure they are correct
GCL Program Rework
- Establish written roles and responsibilities
- Establishing better communication between GCLs and OARS 

Handing unidentified hazardous waste: 
- Can still submit to clean harbors
- put on the label that it is unidentified
    - Clean harbor does this on their own dime 

Checklists & Self Inspections: 
- BFD self inspection on bioraft - “____” self inspection 
    - Didn’t catch the first part of the name 
    - Same place the other yearly inspections are
