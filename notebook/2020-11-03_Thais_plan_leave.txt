Plan for Thais's leave

## Katie will take over purchasing

    - for Kapa/Roche and a couple other vendors, the lab login & pw I got from Bodie were not working so I created new accounts using my email - 
    Katie put updated list in "orders and receipts"

## Molly will take over RCN social media

    - https://github.com/thais-neu/RCNblogpost-notepad/blob/master/RCNSocialMedia.md
    
## dDocent on Discovery

    - https://github.com/thais-neu/BlackSeaBass_project/blob/master/code_notebook/practice_data_analysis.md
    
## Oyster Seascape Data

    - https://github.com/DrK-Lo/EasternOysterEnvData/

## Black Sea Bass genomics: 

    - Thais will double check the boxID for the extracted DNA.

    - We have 62 extracts ready to be sent to library prep and sequencing. The Grabowski lab has tissue samples from MA and RI, and we are waiting on more samples from ME - those were collected in Summer/Fall 2020. From this 2020 batch, select samples for DNA exctraction (based on size of fish) - the goal is to have ~20 good quality DNA extracts from each of the batches/locations collected in 2020 (ME, RI and MA), if possible. What has been done so far:

    - https://github.com/thais-neu/BlackSeaBass_project
    
    - **most relevant data from the repo above is being added to the project's spreadsheet (Biological Sampling Black Sea Bass) on 16-Nov_2020.**
    
    - Sample locations are in the -80oC freezer inventory
    
    - Sequencing facility contact info:

      - I forwarded all emails re library prep and sequencing between myself and Evan to KEL and Alan on 16-Nov-2020.
      
      - The quotes they gave us last year have been added to the github repository on 16-Nov-2020.
         
      - freezer inventory, where the leftover tissue and DNA extracts are: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12TA0x9hPe6B8G34A2ID93ebjxdaGcEiMHAAajCyuQqo/edit?ts=5db7258c#gid=0
    

## List other responsibilities here, or next steps for different analyses. 

- Pipette calibration is due in May-June 2021; 2020 calibration done in coordination with OGL.

- Freezer monitoring systems: https://twentyfour.reescloud.net:11120/index.html - you need a login to view the status of each freezer. We currently have the big -20oC and the -80oC hooked up to this system (little -20oC is not monitored). Folks with login access are: Katie, Thais, Sara and Alan. The old monitoring system (no online monitoring dashboard available) is still operating, for the -80oC only. 

- Reminder: we have 'guest' samples in our -80oC freeezer (Helmuth lab: large cryoboxes labelled Aquarius #1-#13, contact Brian Helmuth or Francis Choi; Hughes lab: oysters from Torrie Hanley, contact Torrie or Randall).
    
- Cleaning reusable supplies in the lab between large projects: https://github.com/thais-neu/Cleaning. We agreed to do this once a year (due December 2020) or at the end of a big genomics project. Done for the first time in December 2019 after Sara Schaal was done with her PhD lab work. Given the limited lab use this year, perhaps wait for Alan's lab work to be completed to do another one.

- Keep track of lab training requirements in BioRaft - no delinquencies as of 17-Nov-2020.
  
- A reminder that I have the lab Mac desktop at my home office - happy to drop off at the lab anytime.

- Lab reopenting - WTF?
