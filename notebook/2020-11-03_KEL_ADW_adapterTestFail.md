# 20201103 - KAPA HyperPlus Kit Failed Test

[Original Report](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/2018OAExp_larvae/blob/master/notebook/20201020_KAPAHyperPrepTest_customPrimers.md)

## Summary
In October Alan tried testing some of our Y-adapters with the KAPA HyperPlus library prep kit (**Will need to go to the lab to get details here**) and the PCR reaction failed. The failed PCR may have been due to user error, kit contamination, or a problem an issue with the adapters.

## Major Steps

### Making Adapter and Primer Stocks

In the test to minimize the likelihood that the adapters and primers were contaminated Alan made new adapter and primer working stocks using molecular grade H2O. 

Stocks created:

| Adapter | Top | Bottom | Final Conc. |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| `Yinline-nobarcode` | `Yinline-nobarcodea` | `Yinline-nobarcodeb` | 15uM |

Standard annealing protocol followed (see link for details).

| Primer | Type | Final Conc. |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|`i5_PCRprimer_L5_D505_CTTCGCCT ` | i5 | 20uM |
| `I5_A508_6bp_picoMethyl_A` | i5 | 20uM |
| `PCR2_09_GATCAG` | i7 | 20uM |

### Library Prep

Standard manufacturers protocol was follow (see link for details). The test were performed using three samples:

| Sample | Adapter | Primer i5 | Primer i7 | Details |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|


1. Adapters were generated from XXXXX and XXXX 100uM stock solution and diluted to 10uM. Be specific about source location of box and label in freezer. Are the stock solutions stored in the -80c?

2. Adapters were used with XXXX kit (any kind of label/date on the kit Alan? Be specific)

3. Any more specifics about what happened
