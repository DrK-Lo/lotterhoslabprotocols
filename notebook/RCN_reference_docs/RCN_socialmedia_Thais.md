## Spread the word:

Every few months, I will try to attract participants to do the Twitter takeover and/or to contribute blog posts to the website. Send emails to your networks, individual emails to people that you think will benefit from and enjoy the experience and tweet from the EvolvingSeas account (and your own, if you want to).

## Twitter takeover

- I usually email the participant the week before, typically Wed – my default 'reminder' email (the attached document mentioned here is the Guidelines file):

```
Dear ,
I hope this email finds you well! 
You are on the calendar to begin tweeting for the RCN-ECS @EvolvingSeas account on DATE. Thanks again for signing up!
In order to set up access to our Twitter account, would you please send the following:
1) the twitter handle you would like me to use to connect you to the account,
2) a headshot (or other image) that you would like to have as the @evolvingseas profile picture during your participation,
3) a short bio (about the length of a single tweet) that I will use to publicize your upcoming participation.
The attached document has more information on the Twitter takeover.
Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns. 
Thank you!
Best,
Thais
```

- Once they respond confirming participation, I reply back with the 'instructions' email: 

```
Thank you!
Here are some details on how the Twitter takeover works:
Retweet - as a curator of the RCN-ECS account you can tweet directly or retweet through @EvolvingSeas account. We suggest that participants tweet through their your OWN account and RE-TWEET through @EvolvingSeas. This way, your identity will be permanently associated with your tweets after we swap the accounts back and move on to the next participant. We will upload the profile picture of your choice as the RCN-ECS profile picture during your week's participation.
*Access* - you will receive an invitation to collaborate in the email account linked to your twitter account. Let me know if you have issues with that. 
*Mon to Fri* - Your week starts on Monday at 8 AM after your participation is publicized, and ends on Friday at 5PM. If you need more time, please let me know! 
Additionally, we ask our contributors to fill out short pre- and post surveys so that we can better assess the impact of this experience, as well as improve it for future contributors. The pre-survey can be found here.
Any questions or problems, please let me know!
Thank you again, and looking forward to your tweets!
Best,
Thais
```

- On Friday, before their week begins:

Use https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/ to:

1. Give participant access to the acccount: Accounts > Manage team > Add a team member (enter their twitter handle and send invitation to collaborate) > Authorize.
 
2. Tweet their participation - I usually schedule a tweet for Monday AM (~8AM) using the provided bio. Welcome the participant, use their name and their twitter handle – often need to edit/shorten the bio. 
> Of course, you can do that on Monday AM without scheduling on tweetdeck, if you prefer.


- On Monday, I usually wait until they tweet for the first time to swap out the profile figure - edit profile and upload their pic to use as profile pic for the week.

- End of the week (Friday 5pm or later if they requested more time):

1. Terminate access to the account: https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/ > Accounts > Team Members > Change role > Remove from team

2. Take down their profile pic and upload RCN logo.

3. Send a thank you note and the post-survey link to the participant via email.

```
thank you again for your contribution to the RCN-ECS Twitter takeover last week! I hope you had fun!
To complement the pre-survey, we're asking our contributors to fill out a short post survey so that we can better assess their experience, and improve it for future contributors.
The post survey can be found here.
Thanks and all the best,
Thais
```


## Blog posts: 

- I usually email the participant the week before, typically Mon (a lot of people don’t realize they have to send you the blog files the week before the week that they signed up for, so an 'early' reminder gives them some extra time in case they forgot) – my default 'reminder' email (the attached document mentioned here is the Guidelines file):

```
Dear PERSON, 
I hope this email finds you well!
This is a friendly reminder that you are on the calendar to contribute a blog post on COPY TOPIC FROM CALENDAR to the Research Coordinated Network - Evolution in Changing Seas website to be published next week (DATE).
Please, send your markdown file and figure files (if any) to me by the end of this week. I will revise the file for web compatibility and typos, and if all looks good to you, we will publish on Monday!
Attached is our social media ethics document with guidelines on how to produce the markdown and figure files for the publication. 
If you have any questions, please let me know!
Thanks!
Best,
Thais`
```

- Once they send you the file(s):

I have a private github repository where I dump their markdown file to see if they are using the correct syntax. A lot of the times the author either doesn't know how to write the markdown or they use incompatible syntax and so the document they will send you is a word document, or a text document with incorrect syntax.

When the post looks good on my repository, I move it to the RCN-ECS github: https://github.com/RCN-ECS/rcn-ecs.github.io

The figure files go in 'Img'

The text file goes in '_posts'

then check https://rcn-ecs.github.io/blog/ to see if it updated properly – it takes some time (a few minutes) to show up.

- Once it shows up, I email the author back to let them know it is published, ask them to double-check for any last-minute edits and tell them you'll tweet the post (ask for their Twitter handle if they want to be tagged). My default email: 

```
Thank you- your post has been published!
ENTER A LINK TO THEIR POST HERE
If you see anything that needs editing, please let me know.
I will tweet your post through the network's account. If you would like to be tagged on the tweet, please, send your twitter handle!
Best,
Thais`
```
- Once they confirm, tweet their post.

## Additional files:

The two report files listed at the top of this entry were fore Katie's RCN report. I intended to do this once a year, so I only have it for the first year (July 2019 to June 2020).

The 'original' SocialMediaEthics document has just fewer details compared to the 2020updated version.
