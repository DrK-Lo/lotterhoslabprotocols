# Equipment
- [ ] Sara - train Remy and Madeline on Core Equipment
- [ ] Alan - train Remy and Madeline on Core Equipment
- [ ] Shared lab space - there is no one responsible for tip waste - people should bring their own containers
- [ ] Shared lab space - electrophoresis room - people need to bring their own waste containers - used pipette tips cannot be in an open container - needs to be in a mayo jar with lid and label

# Freezer
- [ ] Sara and Alan and Thais - train Remy and Madeline on Core Equipment  
    -- [reference lab protocol](https://drk-lo.github.io/lotterhoslabprotocols/general_freezer/)

# Purchasing
- [ ] Thais and Katie will train Remy in Purchasing  
    -- [purchasing protocol](https://github.com/DrK-Lo/lotterhoslabprotocols/blob/gh-pages/notebook/purchasing.md)

    -- [FedEx protocol](https://github.com/DrK-Lo/lotterhoslabprotocols/blob/gh-pages/notebook/fedex_ship.md)

# Data
- [ ]  alan and Sara should think about data accessibility after graduation
- [ ]  Lotterhos lab on Discovery - permissions and folders - KATIE

# Protocols
- [ ] Take3 / Pico Green / plate reader better explanation - Sara
- [ ] Illumina Library Prep - Sara is working on
- [ ] Shared Lab Space - broken links - KATIE
- [ ] Covaris - Sara will check
