  -- this specific entry has a [list of supplies](https://github.com/thais-neu/BlackSeaBass_project/blob/master/genome_notebook/20210804_fishingtrip.md) purchased in 2021 for the project.
  - [ ] KEL add Remy to our list of users on Discovery and give access


# Oyster environment data transition
- [ ] Thais and Katie will train Madeline in oyster [environment data](https://github.com/DrK-Lo/EasternOysterEnvData/)

  - [ ] Remy has training to complete
- [ ] Take Thais, Alan, and Sara off Door sign and Freezer contact list and Freezer monitoring
- [ ] Chemicals - Thais will train Madeline and Remy incoming chemicals, and write protocol
    - [ ] KEL move to protocols [link](https://github.com/DrK-Lo/lotterhoslabprotocols/blob/gh-pages/notebook/chemical_inventory.md)
    - [ ] Determine who will be in charge
- [ ] Waste clearing - Thais will train Madeline and Remy, and write protocol
    - [ ] KEL move to protocols [link](https://github.com/DrK-Lo/lotterhoslabprotocols/blob/gh-pages/notebook/waste_clearing.md) 
    - [ ] Determine who will be in charge
- [ ] KEL Take Thais off the Group Complaince Liason - contact Emma Gubler (e.gubler@northeastern.edu)


# Equipment
- [ ] Sara - train Remy and Madeline on Core Equipment
- [ ] Alan - train Remy and Madeline on Core Equipment
- [ ] Shared lab space - there is no one responsible for tip waste - people should bring their own containers
- [ ] Shared lab space - electrophoresis room - people need to bring their own waste containers - used pipette tips cannot be in an open container - needs to be in a mayo jar with lid and label

# Freezer
- [ ] Sara and Alan and Thais - train Remy and Madeline on Core Equipment  
    -- [reference lab protocol](https://drk-lo.github.io/lotterhoslabprotocols/general_freezer/)
    -- [freezer map](https://github.com/DrK-Lo/lotterhoslabprotocols/blob/gh-pages/notebook/minus80_scheme.png)
    

# Purchasing
- [ ] Thais and Katie will train Remy in Purchasing  
    -- [purchasing protocol](https://github.com/DrK-Lo/lotterhoslabprotocols/blob/gh-pages/notebook/purchasing.md)
    - [ ] KEL move to protocols
- [x] Thais will write FedEx protocol   
    -- [FedEx protocol](https://github.com/DrK-Lo/lotterhoslabprotocols/blob/gh-pages/notebook/fedex_ship.md)
    - [ ] KEL move to protocols
- [ ] TB will update the account with KEL's info

# Data
- [ ]  alan and Sara should think about data accessibility after graduation
- [ ]  Lotterhos lab on Discovery - permissions and folders - KATIE

# Protocols
- [ ] Take3 / Pico Green / plate reader better explanation - Sara
- [ ] Illumina Library Prep - Sara is working on
- [ ] Shared Lab Space - broken links - KATIE
- [ ] Covaris - Sara will check
