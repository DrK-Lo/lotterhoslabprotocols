- [x] Shared lab space - electrophoresis room - people need to bring their own waste containers - used pipette tips cannot be in an open container - needs to be in a mayo jar with lid and label

# Freezer
- [x]  Thais - train Remy and Madeline on freezer
    -- [reference lab protocol](https://drk-lo.github.io/lotterhoslabprotocols/general_freezer/)

# 2021-11-18 Thais & Madeline Lab Transition Meeting


- [x] [Oyster Environmental Data](https://github.com/ModelValidationProgram/EasternOysterEnvData/tree/master/final_site_env)  

* [map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1lgMGFGFNZIHxBEfI2eZBPsmDu_zM06nI&ll=29.095470191097615%2C-85.05581390625001&z=5) sites:
  - P = Wild Populations for which whole genome sequencing is available - we tried to find env data for each pop, [have several different data sources, including USGS & NERR, but also others](https://github.com/ModelValidationProgram/EasternOysterEnvData/tree/master/final_site_env); **these env datasets have been QCed by Thais.**
  - C = new locations to consider collecting new samples. All have sal and temp data; **these env datasets have not been QCed by Thais.**
* env data sources so far are mainly:  
    1. USGS [example](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory?agency_code=USGS&site_no=02327031)  
      - [map](https://dashboard.waterdata.usgs.gov/app/nwd/?region=lower48&aoi=default) > select station > Data > Select Parameters > Output format data-separated > Select data range 
    2. NERR [example](http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/aqs/)  
       - Home > View/download data (map) > Data Graphing and Export System > select site > click on monitoring station from list or map > click to select > Download Data > Select Date Range & Data type (all inclusive) > Proceed to Download > Fill out form > Submit Request to CDMO (you'll get the data file via email within a few minutes, mabye a couple hours).  
       - note there are other ways of batch-requesting data from multiple monitoring stations; we were selecing sites based on proximity to oyster sites, so I did it one by one, as described above.
* data downloads - show how to download from USGS & NERR
* USGS data QC
  - example: [LA_CL_SL_Low_W_Temp](https://github.com/ModelValidationProgram/EasternOysterEnvData/tree/master/final_site_env)
  - 'all data' tab (raw) has unfiltered data.
  - flags are 'A' (approved) and 'P' (provisional-not vetted, usually a time lag of a few months)
  - flag-filtered tab: only includes A datapoints.
* NERR data QC
  - example: [TX_PM_LM_High_W_Temp](https://github.com/ModelValidationProgram/EasternOysterEnvData/tree/master/final_site_env)
  - 'all data' tab (raw) has unfiltered data.
  - multiple flags (historical, provisional, Flag code).
  - flag-filtered tab: flags are more complex in NERR data; we filtered based on Flag codes, excluding data outside of sensor range, QAQC rejected, missing data, field or instrument maintenance days, cause unknown, instrument or sensor malfunction, data collected at wrong depth.
* USGS & NERR Flag-filtered data:
  - Plot whole dataset to double-check for bad data/significant outliers.
  - Included a Year column and a Month column from datetime.
  - Plot Year vs Month to identify significant holes in the dataset.
  - Make a pivot table, will need it to calculate the 'yearly' parameters below.  
  - Calculate data summary: N_all, Mean_all, Stdev_all (from all datatpoints) & N_years, Mean_yearly_max, stdev_yearly_max, Mean_yearly_min, Stdev_yearly_min (from pivot table).
  - **decided against** using dd_0, dd_15, dd_30 because that would be biased by variations in data resolution (every 15min vs monthly; missing winter data or other wholes in datasets)
