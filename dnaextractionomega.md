# Materials and Equipment

## Omega Extraction Kits

### Omega E.Z.N.A. Tissue DNA Kit - Single Sample
 * 200 Samples - Product #: D3396-02 - ~275$
 * ~1.40$ per sample

### Omega E.Z. 96 Tissue DNA Kit - 96 plate
 * 1x96 (96 samples) - Product #: D1196-00 - ~230$
 * ~2.40$ per sample
 * 4x96 (384 samples) - Product #: D1196-01 - ~770$
 * ~2.00$ per sample

### Additional Reagents and Consumables
 * Razors (for cutting up tissue)
 * Flame (sterilization)
 * Weigh paper
 * Kim wipes
 * Pipet tips (10uL,20uL,200uL,1000uL)
 * EtoH (100% - molecular grade)

### Equipment 
 * Micro-scale (need to be able to measure down to 20mg)
 * Thermo-mixer (It has both single sample and plate attachments)
 * Vortexer
 * Microcentrifuge (large centrifuge for plate extractions)
 * Pipets (10uL,20uL,200uL,1000uL)

# Protocol

### Before Starting
 * Heat Elution Buffer to 70 degrees C.
 * Preheat thermo-mixer to 55 degrees C before tissue lysing. After lysing and before beginning extraction, set thermo-mixer to 70 degrees C.
### Tissue Lysing
1. Prep surfaces and area around the scale. First clean with bleach solution, followed by H2O, then 70% EtoH.
2. If working with many samples (>10) get a styrofoam container with ice to keep tissue samples cool while prepping for extraction.
3. Remove tissues from freezer and let thaw (do not let them sit any longer than necessary). Once thawed they can be placed on ice (this generally won't cause them to re-freeze).
4. Tare piece of weighing paper on scale.
5. Carefully remove tissue from 2mL tube. Using a sterile razor blade to cut piece of tissue roughly 20mg in weight. Using 100% EtoH, gently rinse tissue and pat dry with clean kim wipe, so that the tissue appears nearly dry.
6. Place tissue on weigh paper and measure the weight, if the tissue weighs 20mg+/-2mg place it in extraction tube. If not, either remove tissue as necessary or add more from sample tissue.

  **Note:** Between samples razors & forceps should be sterilized by spraying with EtoH and using a flame to burn off any residual EtoH and tissue.

7. Record weight in lab notebook.
8. After tissues have been processed and placed into new 1.5mL tubes, add 200uL of TL Buffer and 25uL of OB Protease Solution to each sample tube.
9. Seal tubes, confirm all labels, then vortex for 15 seconds.
10. Place samples on thermo-mixer set at 55 degrees C at 600 rpm. **BEFORE STARTING THE MIXER:** Make sure all tube caps are securely fastened. In addition, after 2 minutes on the thermo-mixer confirm the tube caps haven't popped open.
11. Samples can be left for at least 3 hours or overnight to allow for all tissue to be completely lysed.

### Extraction
1. Prep surfaces and area around the work bench. First clean with bleach solution, followed by H2O, then 70% EtoH.
2. Pre-label top of spin-column tube and 2 additional 1.5 mL tubes (one label E1 for elution 1 and E2 for elution 2).
3. Centrifuge at maximum speed (â‰¥10,000 x g) for 5 minutes.
4. Transfer the supernatant to a sterile 1.5mL micro centrifuge tube. Do not disturb or transfer any of the insoluble pellet.
5. Add 220uL of BL Buffer. Vortex to mix thoroughly.
6. Incubate at 70 degrees C for 10 minutes.
7. Add 220uL of 100% ethanol. Vortex to mix thoroughly.
8. Pipet the mixture (including any precipitates) into a HiBind DNA Mini Column placed in a 2mL collection tube. 
9. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute. Discard filtrate and reuse the collection tube.
10. Add 500 uL HBC Buffer. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 30 seconds. Discard filtrate and collection tube.
11. Insert the Mini Column into a new 2mL collection tube. 
12. Add 700 uL DNA Wash Buffer. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 30 seconds. Discard filtrate and reuse the collection tube. 
13. Repeat step 12 for a second DNA Wash Buffer wash step.
14. Centrifuge the empty HiBind DNA Mini Column at maximum speed for 2 minutes to dry the column. 
15. Transfer the HiBind Mini Column into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
16. Add 200 uL Elution Buffer heated to 70 degrees C. Let incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes.
17. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.
18. Repeat steps 15-17 for a second elution, with a 10 minute incubation period.
19. Extracted DNA can be place in fridge for a few days, or store at -20 or -80 for long term storage. AVOID numerous freeze-thaw cycles.
