# PicoGreen Assay

[Edit this page](https://github.com/DrK-Lo/lotterhoslabprotocols/edit/main/molecprot_picoGreenAssay.qmd)

The protocol for checking quantification of DNA using the PicoGreen Assay on the Synergy HTX Plate Reader.


::: {.callout-important}
## Important: PicoGreen vs. Quibit
Although the picogreen and quibit both use flourescence to quantify DNA, in our experience the amounts reported by PicoGreen are about twice the amounts reported by Quibit. Therefore, we recommend dividing the Picogreen amounts by 2 and using that number in your calculations.

## **Background** {.unnumbered}

PicoGreen dsDNA Quantitation Reagent is an ultra-sensitive fluorescent nucleic acid stain for quantitating double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in molecular biological procedures such as cDNA synthesis for library production and DNA fragment purification for subcloning, as well as diagnostic applications, such as quantitating DNA amplification products and primer extension assays. The most commonly used technique for measuring nucleic acid concentration is the determination of absorbance at 260 nm (A260).

## **Important Notes** {.unnumbered}
::: {.callout-note}
-   Plate reader can read samples between 25 pg/mL - 1,000 ng/mL (or 0.000025 - 1 ng/uL). To be conservative we make the highest concentration for our ladder 500 ng/mL. 

-   Samples should be diluted to be read within this range. For example, typical <span style="color:red"> QUBIT? </span>
quantifications for Atlantic cod DNA extractions using a spin column plate is between 10 - 200 ng/uL. Therefore, you should do a 1:10 dilution because the reaction does a 1:100 dilution in the reaction itself. This brings the final DNA concentration to 10 - 200 ng/mL which is well within the range of the assay. <span style="color:red"> THEN YOU BACKTRANSFORM TO GET THE CORRECT AMOUNT? </span>. The steps below will explain this in more detail.

-   PicoGreen dye is a solid when stored at 4C. Allow the dye to come to room temperature before use. Take out the kit and leave on the counter before starting protocol to ensure it becomes a liquid. You can pipette TE and samples while it is coming to room temp.

-   The first column of your plate needs to be saved for the ladder standards. Therefore if you are using 6 standards as recommended in this protocol, the most samples you could run on a plate is 90. <span style="color:purple"> For a full plate of 96 samples, you can run standards in the first column and samples in the remaining 11 columns. This would account for 88 samples and you could quantify the remaining 8 samples with Qubit. </span> <span style="color:red"> ADD RECOMMENATION IF DOING A WHOLE PLATE, TO RUN THE 6 SAMPLES ON QUIBIT? </span>

## **Protocol** {.unnumbered}

- <span style="color:purple"> Dilute your DNA samples. For a full plate of 96 samples, only dilute samples in columns 1-11 as this is as many samples as will fit on the PicoGreen plate. Use the E-Pet with a 2mL tip to transfer 2mL of MilliQ H20 into a liquid boat. Using the P100 multichannel pipette, add 20uL of MilliQ H20 to the wells of 11 columns of a 96 well PCR plate. Using the P10 multichannel pipette, add 2uL of your DNA to the corresponding wells in 11 columns of the PCR plate. Seal the PCR plate with a plastic sticker cover, vortex with plate attachment, and centrifuge with 'short' setting and using a tip wafer as a counterweight. This is a 1:10 dilution as required to be read by PicoGreen. </span>

-   Dilute your 20X TE to 1X TE. <span style="color:purple"> Using a 25mL E-Pet tip, pipette 9.5 mL of Molecular Grade H2O into a 15mL falcon tube. Using a p1000 single channel pipette, add 500ul of 20X TE to the falcon tube. </span> This solution is stable long term so you can make more than you will need and store for later use. If you will not be using it frequently, you can also calculate exactly how much you need and just make enough for that use.

-   Create your ladder standards using Table 1. The stock ladder is at 100 ug/mL. <span style="color:purple"> To make Dilution 1 at 2 ug/mL, use the P2.5 and P100 single channel pipettes to combine 1 uL of stock ladder with 49 uL of 1X TE in a 0.2 mL snap cap tube. Vortex and spin Dilution 1 in the mini centrifuge. To make Dilution 2, use the P2.5 and P10 single channel pipettes combine 1uL of Dilution 1 and 9uL of 1X TE in another 0.2 mL snap cap tube. Vortex and spin Dilution 2 in the mini centrifuge. </span> <span style="color:red"> where is table 1? what is Dilution 1? is dilution 1 for samples or ladders? I guess these are explained in the kit? </span>

-   <span style="color:purple"> Pour the 1X TE from the falcon tube into a liquid boat. Using the P100 multichannel, </span> pipette 49 uL of 1X TE in all sample wells. <span style="color:purple"> Using the correct pipette, add </span> the appropriate volume of 1X TE into each standard well according to Table 2. For example, for standard 1, <span style="color:purple"> use the P100 single channel and </span> pipette 25 uL of 1X TE in the appropriate well.

-   <span style="color:purple"> Use the P10 multichannel pipette to add 1 uL of the diluted DNA </span> to each of the sample wells and the appropriate amount of each ladder <span style="color:purple"> (Either Dilution 1 or Dilution 2) </span> to the standard wells according to Table 2. For example, add 25 uL of Ladder Dilution 1 to standard 1 well. 

<span style="color:red"> maybe a conceptual figure would help, showing the wells for the standards and the amounts that go into each one </span>

- <span style="color=purple"> At this point, any wells not being used for samples or standards can remain empty. You do not need to add anything to unused wells. <span)

-   At this point your PicoGreen should be at room temperature. Create your Diluted PicoGreen and use @eq-Pico1 to determine how much stock PicoGreen dye you need for the number of samples/standards you are running. Then use that value to calculate the amount of 1X TE this should be added to for a 200 times dilution using @eq-Pico2.

<span style="color:red"> Maybe we should add an example for how we will do each oyster plate? </span>

-   Pipette diluted PicoGreen to each well with each well getting 50 uL of the 200 times diluted PicoGreen. When adding the diluted PicoGreen pipette up and down at least 20 times to mix sample, TE and PicoGreen together.

<span style="color:red"> I may have missed it, but where is the step where the samples were added? Should we add pipetting tips here? </span>

-   <span style="color:purple"> Cover the plate with a plastic sticker cover and briefly spin down the plate to get all liquid to the bottom of the well. Use the Lotterhos lab centrifuge and a pipette tip wafer as a counterweight.  </span> 
<span style="color:red"> where does the spin down happen? add to equipment </span>

###  Run plate on a Plate Reader using the Gen5 software. 

- First turn on the machine to warm up (takes \~2-3 minutes)

-   Open Gen5 software and on the opening window make sure you are on the "Run Now" option on the left side column and click on the PicoGreen Assay full plate file.

-   This will open another window with a full plate already loaded just click "cancel"

-   Click "Plate Layout" on the top bar which will open a new window to edit with your standard curve and sample wells

-   Clear plate by highlighting "EMPTY" on the left panel and click and drag across whole plate

-   Then right click on the "STD" and click "edit" to change your standard curve values to what you set up for your plate when you are done editing click okay

-   Highlight the first standard curve value in the left panel and click on the appropriate well where that value is located. You can click and drag down the column if they are all in a row.

-   Highlight the first sample (SP1) from the left panel and click on the well with your first sample well and drag across the plate until all wells you want readings for are filled.

-   When this is done click okay and the machine will have a bulb warm up period after which it will ask you to load your plate. You do not need to close the drawer it will close automatically after you load the plate and click "okay".

-   The run should take \~2-3 minutes, then click on the "Statistics" tab and output that spreadsheet to an excel file by copy and pasting.

-   Finally use XXX spreadsheet to convert absorbance values to associated concentrations.

 <span style="color:red"> overall this was hard to follow, some photos or links to an instruction manual would help

Change in protocol? 88 samples quantified on plate reader (leaving one column open for standards + blanks), the rest quantified on qubit

  Add info: 
 Inspect pico green standards curve - if it’s not linear REDO, it should be linear and R^2 should be 0.99 or higher

  Divide plate reader outputs by 2 to standardize measurements to qubit readings

 I am confused about how, if you dilute the sample, the original sample concentration is correctly calculated?

### Calculating Concentrations in ng/uL Using Plate Reader Results

:::
{.callout-note}
## Converting from RFU to ng/uL.
The plate reader outputs concentrations in RFU (relative fluorescence units). You will need to convert these values first to ng/mL, then to ng/uL using the following steps. Keep in mind that the concentrations determined by the PicoGreen are for the 1000X diluted DNA that was created for the assay. This DNA has the unit ng/mL. To find the concentration of the undiluted sample, you will need to multiply your PicoGreen concentration by 1000. Then, to convert from ng/mL to ng/uL, divide by 1000 (1 mL = 1000 uL). Hence, the 1000s cancel out and the value of the concentration of the diluted samples in ng/mL is the same as the value of the concentration of the undiluted samples in ng/uL. See image below for math.

![IMG_0054](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122042203/227622787-860a79c3-8de3-4487-adf3-d04d57e54d44.jpg)
:::

1. Plot your standards in a scatter plot with concentration in ng/mL on the x axis and RFU on the y axis. If doing this in Google Sheets, go to "Series" in the chart editor, and add a linear trendline to the graph. Label the line with the line equation. Check the box next to R^2 to show the R^2 value on the graph. You will use the equation of this line to convert the RFU values for your samples to concentration in ng/mL.

:::
{.callout-tip}
## R^2 Values
The R^2 value describes how well a set of data points fit a particular trendline. A value of 1 indicates a perfect fit, while a value of 0 indicates no fit between points and the line, meaning the line is a poor description of the data. If your R^2 value for the standards is below 0.99, you should redo your PicoGreen assay.
:::

2. Rearrange the equation of the standards line to solve for x. In this case, x is your concentration in ng/mL and y is your RFU value, which the plate reader determined.

3. Make a new tab in the datasheet for concentrations and use the equation above to solve for concentration based on the RFU values. You can copy this equation down the datasheet to avoid having to retype it after writing it the first time.

4. As described above, the resulting concentration is in ng/mL and describes the concentration of the 1000X diluted DNA samples that were used in the PicoGreen assay. In converting from diluted to undiluted DNA and from ng/mL to ng/uL, the conversions cancel out, so the concentrations calculated in this step represent a) the concentration of the diluted DNA in ng/mL and b) the concentration of the undiluted DNA in ng/uL. Describe all original, undiluted DNA concentrations in ng/uL.

5. Record sample concentrations in the datasheet or app.

### Equation 1 {.unnumbered}

Calculates the volume of undiluted stock PicoGreen needed to make diluted PicoGreen for a given number of standards and samples.

 <span style="color:red"> Oh here they are! You can add links in Quarto e.g. @eq-Pico1 (https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#equations) . What is this calculating? The volume of stock that you will need? Also it looks like there is a parenetheses missing here. Should we move up the equation to where it is cited? </span>
 

(1.1 * (50 uL diluted PicoGreen * (#samples + #standards))/200 = (vol of Stock PicoGreen)

$$
\frac{1.1 * 50 \mu L \textrm{ diluted PicoGreen * (Num. samples + Num. standards)}}{200} = \textrm{vol of PicoGreen Stock needed}$$ {#eq-Pico1}
