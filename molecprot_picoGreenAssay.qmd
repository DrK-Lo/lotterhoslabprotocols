# PicoGreen Assay

[Edit this page](https://github.com/DrK-Lo/lotterhoslabprotocols/edit/main/molecprot_picoGreenAssay.qmd)

The protocol for checking quantification of DNA using the PicoGreen Assay on the Synergy HTX Plate Reader.


::: {.callout-important}
## Important: PicoGreen vs. Quibit
Although the PicoGreen and Qubit both use flourescence to quantify DNA, in our experience the amounts reported by PicoGreen are about twice the amounts reported by Qubit. Therefore, we recommend dividing the Picogreen amounts by 2 and using that number in your calculations.

## **Background** {.unnumbered}

PicoGreen dsDNA Quantitation Reagent is an ultra-sensitive fluorescent nucleic acid stain for quantitating double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in molecular biological procedures such as cDNA synthesis for library production and DNA fragment purification for subcloning, as well as diagnostic applications, such as quantitating DNA amplification products and primer extension assays. The most commonly used technique for measuring nucleic acid concentration is the determination of absorbance at 260 nm (A260).

## **Important Notes** {.unnumbered}
::: {.callout-note}
-   Plate reader can read samples between 25 pg/mL - 1,000 ng/mL (or 0.000025 - 1 ng/uL). To be conservative we make the highest concentration for our ladder 500 ng/mL. 

-   Samples should be diluted to be read within this range. For example, typical <span style="color:red"> QUBIT? </span>
quantifications for Atlantic cod DNA extractions using a spin column plate is between 10 - 200 ng/uL. Therefore, you should do a 1:10 dilution because the reaction does a 1:100 dilution in the reaction itself. This brings the final DNA concentration to 10 - 200 ng/mL which is well within the range of the assay. The steps below will explain this in more detail. See Calculating Concentrations (@sec-CalculatingConcs) for more info.

-   PicoGreen dye is a solid when stored at 4C. Allow the dye to come to room temperature before use. Take out the kit and leave on the counter before starting protocol to ensure it becomes a liquid. You can pipette TE and samples while it is coming to room temp.

-   The first column of your plate needs to be saved for the ladder standards. Therefore if you are using 6 standards and 2 empty wells as recommended in this protocol, the most samples you could run on a plate is 88. <span style="color:purple"> For a full plate of 96 samples, you can run standards/blanks in the first column and samples in the remaining 11 columns. This would account for 88 samples and you could quantify the remaining 8 samples with Qubit. </span>.

## **Protocol** {.unnumbered}

- <span style="color:purple"> Dilute your DNA samples. For a full plate of 96 samples, only dilute samples in columns 1-11 as this is as many samples as will fit on the PicoGreen plate. Use the E-Pet with a 2mL tip to transfer 2mL of MilliQ H20 into a liquid boat. Using the P100 multichannel pipette, add 20uL of MilliQ H20 to the wells of 11 columns of a 96 well PCR plate. Using the P10 multichannel pipette, add 2uL of your DNA to the corresponding wells in 11 columns of the PCR plate. Seal the PCR plate with a plastic sticker cover, vortex with plate attachment, and centrifuge with 'short' setting and using a tip wafer as a counterweight. This is a 1:10 dilution as required to be read by PicoGreen. </span>

-   Dilute your 20X TE to 1X TE. <span style="color:purple"> Using a 25mL E-Pet tip, pipette 9.5 mL of Molecular Grade H2O into a 15mL falcon tube. Using a p1000 single channel pipette, add 500ul of 20X TE to the falcon tube. </span> This solution is stable long term so you can make more than you will need and store for later use. If you will not be using it frequently, you can also calculate exactly how much you need and just make enough for that use.

-   Create your ladder standards using Table 1. The stock ladder is at 100 ug/mL. <span style="color:purple"> To make Dilution 1 at 2 ug/mL, use the P2.5 and P100 single channel pipettes to combine 1 uL of stock ladder with 49 uL of 1X TE in a 0.2 mL snap cap tube. Vortex and spin Dilution 1 in the mini centrifuge. To make Dilution 2, use the P2.5 and P10 single channel pipettes combine 1uL of Dilution 1 and 9uL of 1X TE in another 0.2 mL snap cap tube. Vortex and spin Dilution 2 in the mini centrifuge. </span>

- <span style="color=purple"> At this point, any wells not being used for samples or standards can remain empty. You do not need to add anything to unused wells. </span>

-   Your PicoGreen should be at room temperature, but if it's not, hold it in your hand to help it defrost. Create your diluted PicoGreen and use @eq-Pico1 to determine how much stock PicoGreen dye you need for the number of samples/standards you are running. Then use that value to calculate the amount of 1X TE this should be added to for a 200 times dilution using @eq-Pico2.

### Equation 1 {.unnumbered}

- Calculates the volume of undiluted stock PicoGreen needed to make diluted PicoGreen for a given number of standards and samples.

$$
\frac{1.1 * 50 \mu L \textrm{ diluted PicoGreen * (Num. samples + Num. standards)}}{200} = \textrm{vol PicoGreen Stock needed}$$ {#eq-Pico1}

### Equation 2 {.unnumbered}

- Calculate the volume of 1X TE needed to dilute the stock PicoGreen

$$ 199 * \textrm{vol of Stock PicoGreen} = \textrm{vol of 1x TE}$$ {#eq-Pico2}

-   Pipette diluted PicoGreen to each well with each well getting 50 uL of the 200 times diluted PicoGreen. When adding the diluted PicoGreen pipette up and down at least 20 times to mix sample, TE and PicoGreen together.

-   <span style="color:purple"> Cover the plate with a plastic sticker cover and briefly spin down the plate to get all liquid to the bottom of the well. Use the Lotterhos lab centrifuge and a pipette tip wafer as a counterweight.  </span> 

###  Run Plate on Reader using Gen5 Software

-   First switch on the plate reader to warm up (takes \~2-3 minutes).

![](img/IMG_1956.png)

-   Using the laptop next to the reader, open Gen5 software. On the opening window make sure you are in the "Run Now" option on the left side column and click on the PicoGreen Assay full plate file.

![](img/IMG_1957.png)

![](img/IMG_1958.png)

-   This will open another window with a full plate already loaded. Click "cancel."

![](img/IMG_1959.png)

-   Click the "Plate Layout" symbol on the top bar. It looks like a little plate with a red circle over one of the wells. This will open a new window with a 96 well plate. You can then specify where your standards, blanks, empty wells, and standard wells are.

![](img/IMG_1960.png)

-   Clear plate by highlighting "EMPTY" on the left panel and click and drag across whole plate.

![](img/IMG_1961.png)

-   Click the first standard curve value in the left panel and click on the well where that standard is located. You can click and drag down the column to fill in remaining standards if they are in numeric order.

![](img/IMG_1962.png)

-   Highlight the first sample (SP1) from the left panel and click on the well with your first sample well and drag across the plate until all wells you want readings for are filled.

![](img/IMG_1963.png)

-   When this is done click okay. The machine will have a bulb warm up period after which it will ask you to load your plate. You do not need to close the drawer it will close automatically after you load the plate and click "okay".

::: {.callout-important}
## Plate Orientation
Make sure the plate is loaded with well A1 in the top left. There's a marker for A1 in the top left corner of the plate reader tray to indicate how to orient the plate. You can only run a plate through the reader **once**, so make sure you run it properly.
:::

-   The run should take \~2-3 minutes. Once complete, click on the "Statistics" tab and output that spreadsheet to an excel file or Google sheet by copying to clipboard and pasting.

![](img/IMG_1964.png)

![](img/IMG_1965.png)

-   Finally use the spreadsheet to convert absorbance values to associated concentrations.

## Calculating Concentrations {#sec-CalculatingConcs}

::: {.callout-note}
## Converting RFU to ng/uL
The plate reader outputs concentrations in RFU (relative fluorescence units). You will need to convert these values first to ng/mL, then to ng/uL using the following steps. Keep in mind that the concentrations determined by the PicoGreen are for the 1000X diluted DNA that was created for the assay. This DNA has the unit ng/mL. To find the concentration of the undiluted sample, you will need to multiply your PicoGreen concentration by 1000. Then, to convert from ng/mL to ng/uL, divide by 1000 (1 mL = 1000 uL). Hence, the 1000s cancel out and the value of the concentration of the diluted samples in ng/mL is the same as the value of the concentration of the undiluted samples in ng/uL. See image below for math.
![IMG_0054](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122042203/227622787-860a79c3-8de3-4487-adf3-d04d57e54d44.jpg)
:::

1. Plot your standards in a scatter plot with concentration in ng/mL on the x axis and RFU on the y axis. If doing this in Google Sheets, go to "Series" in the chart editor, and add a linear trendline to the graph. Label the line with the line equation. Check the box next to R^2 to show the R^2 value on the graph. You will use the equation of this line to convert the RFU values for your samples to concentration in ng/mL.

::: {.callout-tip} 
## R^2 Values
The R^2 value describes how well a set of data points fit a particular trendline. A value of 1 indicates a perfect fit, while a value of 0 indicates no fit between points and the line, meaning the line is a poor description of the data. If your R^2 value for the standards is below 0.99, you should redo your PicoGreen assay.
:::

**Example of a Good Standard Plot (R=1)**
![RFU vs  Conc ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122042203/227982062-86495ffb-960a-4899-afe8-d7ed5cd36a4d.png)

**Example of a Bad Standard Plot (R=0.86)

![RFU vs  Concentration (ng_uL)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122042203/228553583-dc3a17fd-414b-4ad8-a737-eb942a5cf0cf.png)

- If your standard curve has an R^2 value of less than 0.99 as in the example above, redo the PicoGreen assay.

2. Rearrange the equation of the standards line to solve for x. In this case, x is your concentration in ng/mL and y is your RFU value, which the plate reader determined.

3. Make a new tab in the datasheet for concentrations and use the equation above to solve for concentration based on the RFU values. You can copy this equation down the datasheet to avoid having to retype it after writing it the first time.

4. As described above, the resulting concentration is in ng/mL and describes the concentration of the 1000X diluted DNA samples that were used in the PicoGreen assay. In converting from diluted to undiluted DNA and from ng/mL to ng/uL, the conversions cancel out, so the concentrations calculated in this step represent a) the concentration of the diluted DNA in ng/mL and b) the concentration of the undiluted DNA in ng/uL. Describe all original, undiluted DNA concentrations in ng/uL.

5. Divide sample concentrations by 2 to make up for the 2x difference between PicoGreen and Qubit concentrations sample. This value represents the final concentration of your undiluted samples in ng/uL.

6. Record sample concentrations in the datasheet or app.
