The protocol for quantifying DNA/RNA samples using the Take3.

 # Which water?
 
 * Use molecular grade water for all lab work. We buy this from Fisher and it is stored on the chemical shelf.
 
 * Do you need DI water? We don't use the MSC DI water, because it costs several hundred dollars per year to use. We can order several liters at a time from Fisher.
 
 * Make sure to autoclave your molecular grade water in aliquots before preparing your libraries. 
 
 # Which ethanol?
 
 * Store DNA in 100% molecular grade ethanol
 * Be sure when using bead washes to use the correct ethanol
 * Use cheaper 95% ethanol for washing countertops
 * Do not store oyster shells in ethanol - it messes with the calcium carbonate matrix
