# Seascape Sample Extractions App Use

[Edit this page](https://github.com/DrK-Lo/lotterhoslabprotocols/edit/main/molecprot_SSEapp.qmd)

The Seascape Sample Extractions (SSE) app is an app designed by Katie Lotterhos through Appsheet. It helps keep track of all data relating to the oyster DNA extracted as part of the Model Validation Program experiment. The app connects to this [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nLMK4ucERX90T4lV7ivLZ0HEBaGvwawnA3XHPsKt9Uk/edit) and all data entered in the app shows up in the sheet. As of 07/07/2023, data added to the app will show up in the sheet, but data entered into the sheet will not necessarily populate in the app.

## Accessing the SSE App

To access SSE, Katie will need to send an invite to your Google account. Once you have accepted the invite, you can access the app in the following ways:

- By downloading the Appsheet app to your personal device (phone, tablet, etc)
- Through the [web version](https://www.appsheet.com/start/f58f8dbb-1d41-4d2d-a917-dfe554b1144f#appName=SeascapeSamplesExtractions-6377443&group=%5B%7B%22Column%22%3A%22Date_SentSequencing%22%2C%22Order%22%3A%22Ascending%22%7D%5D&page=deck&sort=%5B%5D&table=1_Plate&view=plate) on a computer

You will need to be signed into an invited Google account to use SSE. We have a lab iPad with the app downloaded and signed into that you are welcome to use.

## App Overview

Use SSE during DNA extractions to enter the following data:

- Extraction dates
- Lysis start and end times
- Weights of tissues before lysis
- Elution buffer info
- DNA quantification data
- Gel images of extracted DNA
- Additional extraction plans for replacement samples

The image below shows your app gallery, or all the Appsheet programs you have access to. Select the Seascape Sample Extractions App.

The app usually opens on the "plate" page. You can switch pages by clicking the icons at the bottom. See also the menu icon and the app refresh button, which you will need to click if any updates are made to the app structure.

## Data Entry

### Extraction Dates

- At the start of an extraction, you will need to enter it as a new extraction date. Click on the plate you're extracting DNA from on the "plates" page shown above. 

- On the next page that comes up, you'll see a section called "Extraction_plans", which contains the plan label for every sample being extracted in that plate. Scroll down to the "Extraction_Dates" section. Click "Add" to input a new date.

- Fill in the boxes with the requested info. You won't be able to fill in any information past "Time lysis start" on the first day. **Remember to come back to this page and fill in the rest of the info as the extraction moves forward.**

- Click save when finished. You should be taken back to the overview page of whatever plate you're working with.
