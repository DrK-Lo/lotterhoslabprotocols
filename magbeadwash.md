title: Magnetic Bead Wash
subtitle: The protocol for doing a magnetic bead wash
---

# Overview
Magnetic beads are used for purification and size selection of single or double-stranded DNA. size selection may be performed at the
following points during the overall library construction
process:
- before or after DNA fragmentation;
- after individual enzymatic reactions;
- after the first post-ligation cleanup; or
- after library amplification.

We use [Kapa Pure Beads](https://www.kapabiosystems.com/document/kapa-pure-beads-tds/?dl=1) for magnetic bead washes. We find that they work as well as the Ampure Beads and are MUCH cheaper.


Before using, be sure to read the [PDF](https://www.kapabiosystems.com/document/kapa-pure-beads-tds/?dl=1) from Kapa.

## Cleanup genomic DNA

1.1 Ensure that KAPA Pure Beads has been equilibrated
to room temperature and that the beads are fully
resuspended before proceeding.

1.2 Add 300 μL of KAPA Pure Beads (3:1 ratio for gDNA) to the 100 μL
genomic DNA sample.

1.3 Mix thoroughly by vortexing and/or pipetting up
and down multiple times.

1.4 Incubate the plate/tube(s) at room temperature for
10 min to bind the DNA to the beads.

1.5 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture the
beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear.

1.6 Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.

1.7 Keeping the plate/tube(s) on the magnet, add
200 μL of 80% ethanol.

1.8 Incubate the plate/tube(s) on the magnet at room
temperature for ≥30 sec.

1.9 Carefully remove and discard the ethanol.

1.10 Keeping the plate/tube(s) on the magnet, add
200 μL of 80% ethanol.

1.11 Incubate the plate/tube(s) on the magnet at room
temperature for ≥30 sec.

1.12 Carefully remove and discard the ethanol. Try
to remove all residual ethanol without disturbing
the beads.

1.13 Dry the beads at room temperature for 3 – 5 min,
or until all of the ethanol has evaporated. Caution:
over-drying the beads may result in reduced yield.

1.14 Remove the plate/tube(s) from the magnet.

1.15 Resuspend the beads in an appropriate volume of
pre-heated elution buffer at 37°C and/or perform
the elution incubation (step 1.16) in a thermocycler
or heating block set to 37°C. The appropriate
elution buffer may be either 10 mM Tris-HCl,
(pH 8.0 – 8.5) or PCR-grade water, depending on
the downstream application.

1.16 Incubate the plate/tube(s) for 10 min to elute the
DNA off the beads.

1.17 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture the
beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear.

1.18 Transfer the clear supernatant to a new plate/
tube(s). Proceed with your downstream application,
or store DNA at 4ºC for 1 – 2 weeks, or at -20ºC.

#### Notes
* 3X KAPA Pure Beads to-sample
volumetric ratio recommended
* The detailed protocol below is an example of a
3X  cleanup of genomic DNA in 100 µL. Please
pay special attention to steps 1.15 and 1.16
(elution of DNA off beads). To ensure optimal
recovery, these steps may be performed at an
elevated temperature: 37°C for 10 min. Elution
buffer may be pre-heated for this step and/or the
elution performed in a thermocycler or heating
block. 

* As indicated above, a heated elution is recommended
to ensure optimal recovery of high-quality genomic
DNA. This is not a requirement for the cleanup of other
DNA types (e.g. fragmented DNA).

* For maximum recovery of the original DNA sample
during cleanup, buffer exchange, and/or concentration
of genomic DNA, fragmented DNA for NGS library
construction, PCR or qPCR products—regardless of
quality—a KAPA Pure Beads-to-sample volumetric
ratio of 3X is recommended. Expected recoveries
are 50 – 90%, depending upon sample quality and
quantity. If a lower ratio is used, it may result in lower
yields and exclusion of smaller fragments.

## Cleanup of fragmented DNA

2.1 Ensure that KAPA Pure Beads has been equilibrated
to room temperature and that the beads are fully
resuspended before proceeding.

2.2 Add 80 μL of KAPA Pure Beads to the 100 μL
fragmented DNA sample.

2.3 Mix thoroughly by vortexing and/or pipetting up
and down multiple times.

2.4 Incubate the plate/tube(s) at room temperature for
5 – 15 min to bind the DNA to the beads.

2.5 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture the
beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear.

2.6 Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.

2.7 Keeping the plate/tube(s) on the magnet, add
200 μL of 80% ethanol.

2.8 Incubate the plate/tube(s) on the magnet at room
temperature for ≥30 sec.

2.9 Carefully remove and discard the ethanol.

2.10 Keeping the plate/tube(s) on the magnet, add
200 μL of 80% ethanol.

2.11 Incubate the plate/tube(s) on the magnet at room
temperature for ≥30 sec.

2.12 Carefully remove and discard the ethanol. Try
to remove all residual ethanol without disturbing
the beads.

2.13 Dry the beads at room temperature for 3 – 5 min,
or until all of the ethanol has evaporated. Caution:
over-drying the beads may result in reduced yield.

2.14 Remove the plate/tube(s) from the magnet.

2.15 Resuspend the beads in an appropriate volume
of elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 – 8.5) or
PCR-grade water, depending on the downstream
application.

2.16 Incubate the plate/tube(s) at room temperature for
2 min to elute the DNA off the beads. The elution
time may be extended up to 10 min if necessary to
improve DNA recovery.

2.17 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture the
beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear.

2.18 Transfer the clear supernatant to a new plate/
tube(s). Proceed with your downstream application,
or store DNA at 4ºC for 1 – 2 weeks, or at -20ºC.

## Size Selection

3.1 Ensure that KAPA Pure Beads has been equilibrated
to room temperature and that the beads are fully
resuspended before proceeding.

3.2 Perform the first size cut (0.6X, to exclude large
library fragments) by adding 30 μL of KAPA
Pure Beads to 50 μL of adapter-ligated library
(0.6 x 50 μL = 30 μL).

3.3 Mix thoroughly by vortexing and/or pipetting up
and down multiple times.

3.4 Incubate the plate/tube(s) at room temperature
for 5 – 15 min to bind large library molecules
(>450 bp) to the beads.

3.5 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture the
beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear.

3.6 Carefully transfer the supernatant containing the
smaller library molecules (<450 bp) to a new plate/
tube(s). It is critical that no beads are transferred
with the supernatant.

3.7 Discard the plate/tube(s) containing the beads to
which library fragments larger than ~450 bp are
bound.

3.8 Perform the second size cut (0.8X) by adding
10 μL of KAPA Pure Beads to the supernatant. This
volume is calculated relative to the original sample
volume of 50 μL, e.g., (0.8 – 0.6) x 50 μL = 10 μL.

3.9 Mix thoroughly by vortexing and/or pipetting up
and down multiple times.

3.10 Incubate the plate/tube(s) at room temperature for
5 – 15 min to bind library molecules >250 bp to
the beads.

3.11 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture
the beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear.
Carefully remove and discard the supernatant
which contains library molecules smaller than
>250 bp.

3.12 Keeping the plate/tube(s) on the magnet, add
200 μL of 80% ethanol.

3.13 Incubate the plate/tube(s) on the magnet at room
temperature for ≥30 sec.

3.14 Carefully remove and discard the ethanol.
3.15 Keeping the plate/tube(s) on the magnet, add
200 μL of 80% ethanol.

3.16 Incubate the plate/tube(s) on the magnet at room
temperature for ≥30 sec.

3.17 Carefully remove and discard the ethanol. Try
to remove all residual ethanol without disturbing
the beads.

3.18 Dry the beads at room temperature for 3 – 5 min,
or until all of the ethanol has evaporated. ⚠️ **Caution:
over-drying the beads may result in reduced yield.**

3.19 Remove the plate/tube(s) from the magnet.

3.20 Thoroughly resuspend the beads in the required
volume of elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.0 – 8.5), or PCR-grade water, depending on
the downstream application.

3.21 Incubate the plate/tube(s) at room temperature
for 2 min to elute DNA off the beads. The elution
time may be extended up to 10 min if necessary to
improve DNA recovery.

3.22 Place the plate/tube(s) on a magnet to capture the
beads. Incubate until the liquid is clear.

3.23 Transfer the clear supernatant with size-selected
DNA to a new plate/tube(s). Proceed with your
downstream application, or store DNA at 4ºC for
1 – 2 weeks, or at -20ºC.

#### Notes
Bead-based size selection or “double-sided size
selection” consists of a “first” and “second cut”,
represented as ratios of beads-to-sample volumes. 

## Factors that Impact Overall Performance

* Store at 2°C to 8°C in a constant-temperature
refrigerator; do not store at -20°C. **Always ensure that KAPA**
**Pure Beads is fully equilibrated to room temperature**
**before use.**

* For optimal performance, always ensure that
the KAPA Pure Beads is equilibrated to room
temperature, that the beads are fully resuspended
before use, and that the DNA and bead solutions are
thoroughly mixed prior to the binding incubation.

* The volumetric ratio of KAPA Pure Beads to sample is the
critical factor in determining the size distribution of DNA
fragments retained by the beads. The volume (ratio) may
be modified/optimized based upon the specific application
and/or point in the library construction workflow where a
cleanup or size selection is employed.

* The volume in which cleanups and size selection are
performed may impact performance. DNA samples may
be diluted in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 – 8.5) or PCR-grade
water to increase the working volume prior to the addition
of KAPA Pure Beads. This is recommended for starting
volumes <50 µL, DNA preparations that are viscous, and/
or contain a high concentration of salts or PEG.

* It is important to prepare fresh 80% ethanol prior to
use, since ethanol absorbs atmospheric water. 

* The volume of 80% ethanol used for bead washes may be
adjusted to accommodate different plate/tube volumes
and/or limited pipetting capacity, but it is important that
the beads are entirely submerged during the wash steps.
Where possible, use a wash volume that is equal to the
volume of sample plus KAPA Pure Beads.

* It is important to remove all ethanol before proceeding
with subsequent reactions. However, over-drying of
beads may make them difficult to resuspend, and may
result in a dramatic loss of DNA. Drying of beads for
3 – 5 min at room temperature should be sufficient.
Drying of beads at 37ºC is not recommended.

* Elution time and temperature may impact DNA recovery,
particularly for high-molecular weight genomic DNA.

* Purified DNA in elution buffer should be stable at 4°C
for 1 – 2 weeks, or for at least 1 month at -20°C. The
long-term stability of library DNA at -20°C depends on
a number of factors, including library concentration.
Always use low DNA-binding tubes for long-term
storage and avoid excessive freezing and thawing.

* To increase the recovery of DNA at a specific stage
in an NGS library construction protocol, the volume
of KAPA Pure Beads used in the cleanup may be
increased, but this will most likely result in the retention
of smaller DNA fragments.

#### Upper size limit | Modification
* Increase upper size limit:  Decrease the ratio of the first cut
* Decrease upper size limit: Increase the ratio of the first cut

#### Lower size limit | Modification
* Increase lower size limit: Decrease the ratio of the second cut
* Decrease lower size limit: Increase the ratio of the second cut

* The second size cut should be performed with at
least 0.2 volumes of KAPA Pure Beads. Please note
the volume of the KAPA Pure Beads needed for the
second cut is calculated relative to the volume of the
sample at the start of the size selection procedure,
not the volume of the DNA-containing supernatant
transferred after the first cut.  DNA recovery is dramatically reduced if
the difference between the first and second cuts is less
than ~0.2  volumes. To increase the amount of DNA
recovered, more than 0.2 volumes of KAPA Pure Beads
may be used for the second cut, but note that this may
result in the recovery of smaller library fragments and a
broader size distribution.
