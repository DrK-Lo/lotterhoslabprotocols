* *Negativity bias* (Goleman research)
    * If we perceive our email as positive, the receiver perceives it as neutral
    * If we perceive our email as neutral, the receiver perceives it as negative
    * This happens because of absence of normal social cues
    * Play close attention to phrasing
    
* *Busy bias*
    * every email is colored by how busy we are and if we feel we have time for it
    * 10 years ago we spent 0 time on social media because it didn't exist. Now we spend 1.72 hours a day.
