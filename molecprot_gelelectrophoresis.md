# Materials and Equipment
1. Agarose
2. 1X TBE
3. GelRed® 10,000X stock reagent (left-top drawer in the room with gel docks).
4. Erlenmeyer flask (should be in the room with gel docks).
## Protocol
1. Tare a weigh boat on the scale.
2. Add 1.4 g of agarose to the weigh boat.
3. Pour 70 mL of 1x TBE buffer into a graduated cylinder.
4. Pour 35-40 mL of the TBE buffer into an Erlenmeyer flask, then add the agarose and swirl.
5. Microwave solution for ~45 seconds, or until it begins to boil.
6. Add more TBE buffer, but leave 10-20 mL in the graduated cylinder.
7. Microwave solution again until it begins to boil. Repeat until agarose is completely dissolved.
8. Add remaining TBE buffer (to cool solution).
9. Dilute the GelRed® 10,000X stock reagent into the molten agarose gel solution at 1:10,000 and mix thoroughly.
    - (e.g., 5 µL of the GelRed 10,000X stock reagent added to 50 mL of the gel solution)
