## Receiving Orders
Typically, Sonya will e-mail you when you or the lab has received a package. Try to pick them up as soon as possible, **especially if it needs to be refrigerated**

1. When you receive the package, unbox, and make sure you have the packing slip
2. **LABEL EVERYTHING WITH \'LOTTERHOS\'**
3. Put items in correct location
4. Add order to lab Quartzy inventory, specifying location. **Tip: if you put in company and correct item number, it will autofill details**
5. Cardboard boxes can be placed in hall for Roberto to pick up or can be walked to dumpster
6. Bring packing slip to Sonya's office
7. If item is important, you can also send message on \#orders slack channel saying that it has been received
