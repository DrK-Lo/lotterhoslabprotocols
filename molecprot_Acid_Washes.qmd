# Cleaning Qiagen S-Blocks for reuse
[Edit this page](https://github.com/DrK-Lo/lotterhoslabprotocols/edit/main/molecprot_Acid_Washes.qmd)

After each use, the S-Blocks <span style="color:purple"> from the Qiagen plate extraction kit </span> must be sterilized for re-use.

<span style="color:red"> HOW ARE WE GOING TO KEEP TRACK IF IT'S BEEN STERILIZED OR NOT? E.G. IF A LONG TIME HAS GONE BY AND A NEW GROUP OF PEOPLE COMES IN, IT WOULD BE BEST TO RE-STERILIZE ANYWAY </span>

**Materials**

- 0.4M HCl solution
- Glass 6in x 6in x 8in container for bath
- ddH2O from Lotterhos lab, **not** from shared tap in MSC gel room
- fume hood
- container filled with ddH2O to submerge S-Block for rinsing

1. We often keep a pre-made HCl bath in the clear glass container in the fumehood labeled "0.4 M HCl. for acid washing"  container in the fume hood. If making a new bath, and **add the quantity of acid to the quantity of water** not the other way around. 

2. If a bath is not pre-made, prepare 1.5L of a 0.4M HCl bath in the glass container in the fume hood. Use the 12M HCl located in the corrosives cabinet and the DI water located in the jug to the right of the sink. Measure out 1L DI water using a graduated cylinder and pour into the container in the hood. Measure out another 450mL DI water. In the fumehood, pour 50 mL 12M HCl into the cylinder with the water. Then slowly pour this mixture into the 1L DI water in the container. 
  - If you need a different volume of .4M HCl, use the equation: (Conc1)(Vol1) = (Conc2)(Vol2) 
  - Ex. (12M HCl) x (Vol HCl to dillute down to .4M) = (.4M HCl) x (1.5 L diluted HCl)

3. Get a red plastic container labelled "no animals". These are usually found near the sink. Move container into the fume hood and fill with enough tap water to submerge the S-Block. 

4. Carefully submerge S-Block in 0.4M HCl bath for one minute. Ensure no bubbles are trapped in the wells, or the block will not get fully decontaminated.

5. Transfer S-Block to the water container and submerge a few times to rinse. Again, ensure no bubbles are trapped in the wells.

6. Leave S-Block on drying rack above sink. 

7. S-Blocks should be autoclaved after washing.

8. If making a new HCl bath, dispose of HCl in large brown bottle with a hazardous waste label that says "hydrochloric acid, 1.25%", found under the RNA hood/PCR cabinet. Complete the transfer of HCl to the hazardous waste bottle in the fume hood.
