# Cleaning the S-Blocks for reuse

1. After each use, rinse the S-Blocks thoroughly in tap water

2. Incubate for 1 min at room temperature in 0.4M HCl
- HCl is located in the corrosives cabinet
- Place S-Block into 1000mL beaker. Place beaker into secondary container (large red plastic bin)
- Carefully pour 0.4HCl over S-Block until S-Block is nearly submerged
- To submerge, place another beaker filled with water on top of the S-Block to weight it down

3. Wash S-Block thoroughly with distilled water
- Transfer S-Block to another 1000mL beaker filled with distilled water
- Submerge S-Block a few times to rinse
- Over the sink, thoroughly rinse by pouring more distilled water over S-Block

4. Dispose of HCl and HCl-contaminated dH20 in large hazardous waste bottle (5L or 1 gal).
