# Materials and Equipment
## Protocol
1. Tare a weigh boat on the scale.
2. Add 1.4 g of agarose to the weigh boat.
3. Pour 70 mL of 1x TBE buffer into a graduated cylinder.
4. Pour 35-40 mL of the TBE buffer into an Erlenmeyer flask, then add the agarose and swirl.
5. Microwave solution for ~45 seconds, or until it begins to boil.
6. Add more TBE buffer, but leave 10-20 mL in the graduated cylinder.
7. Microwave solution again until it begins to boil. Repeat until agarose is completely dissolved.
8. Add remaining TBE buffer (to cool solution).
9. Carefully add 2 uL of ethidium bromide and swirl to diffuse.
