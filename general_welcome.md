# Welcome to the Lotterhos Lab!

This page will be a good start to getting yourself settled in the lab. If you
have any questions after reading through this, don't be afraid to ask other
members of the lab (and write the questions down so we can add it to this page
:D).  

## Safety First

This will help you know where certain items are in the lab that will help keep you and others safe:

* __Safety Data Sheets and Hazardous Waste__:
  * All safety data sheets, chemical inventory and hazardous waste labels are in this binder...
    ![Alt text](/img/labSafetyBinder.jpg)
* __Hazardous Waste__:
  * Clean Harbors now does pick up and transportation of chemical waste
    containers. They will come around to each of the labs that have filled out
    the [online pick up sheet](https://ehsa.nunet.neu.edu/neu_wp) on __the last Tuesday of every month__.
  * At this same time, Clean harbors should bring the extra hazardous waste
    containers that have been requested by members of the lab.
  * If our secondary containment is overflowing in the middle of the month,
    notify Ryan and he will transport the containers to the central accumulation
    area.
  * Lastly, do your best to fill out the hazardous waste labels correctly. Use
    the SDS of the chemical that you have been working with to help fill out the
    label.

## Shared Lab Space

* The first door on the right as you enter the hall where labs are located is
  the shared lab space. Here is where you will be able to find most of the
  equipment that you need that is not in the lab.
  * __OpenTrons pipetting robot__
  * __BluePippin__ - DNA Size Selection for Next-Gen Sequencing
  * __Sonicator__ - DNA Shearing
  * __Agilent TapeStation__ - Quantification and quality assessment of RNA, DNA
    (including genomic DNA) and protein samples.
  * __Synergy HTX ('Plate reader')__ - DNA Quantification of a large amount of samples.
  * __Centrifuge__ - Centrifuging large volume containers (Falcon tubes).
* While using the equipment is encouraged whenever it is needed, it is necessary
  that you log your use on the [common lab space spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M0RQYTqQwLS7puzn443S4CVAufBNgKyocfamQ179edU/edit#gid=0) for auditing
  purposes.
  * It is also important to log your uses of other shared equipment such as the autoclave, gel imager, NanoDrop, etc.

## Computing

* Our lab and some other labs at the MSC have access to a computing cluster
  (defiance) so we can run scripts and simulations that may take days to run.
  Refer to [this page](https://drk-lo.github.io/lotterhoslabprotocols/defiance/)
  in order to gain access and learn how to use defiance.
