## Placing Orders on myMarketplace
Most supplies for the lab are ordered through companies that Northeastern has accounts with, such as Fisher, Sigma Aldrich or VWR
To order from these companies:

1. Log on to myNortheastern
2. Go to Services & Links -> myMarketplace (Under \'Finance Services for Faculty\\Staff\')
3. Log on to myMarketplace
4. Scroll down and select the company you want to order from (e.g., Fisher Scientific)
5. Search for your desired item
6. Choose price and quantity
7. Add to cart
8. Continue adding items to cart
9. Once all items are in the cart, go to cart symbol in upper right hand corner and select \'View Cart\'
10. Review order. If everything is correct go to \'Return Cart to Purchasing Application\'
11. Click \'Submit\'. You will return to myMarketplace
12. From here, choose the index (the budget code, depending on the project), the account code (typically Scientific Supplies), and how much to cover with this budget code (typically 100%)
13. Click \'Send to Approval\'
**DO NOT FORGET STEPS BELOW**
14. Once you receive a confirmation e-mail with the receipt of the purchase forward it to the Business and Operations Manager (currently Heather Sears) and David Dawson. CC Katie on the e-mail
15. **In the body of the e-mail put the index number it was charged to**
16. Download PDF of the receipt, rename to date\_company\_item (e.g. 20180505\_Fisher\_Gloves) and add it to the Dropbox Folder : LotterhosLab/orders and receipts 
**Katie will need these receipts to do budgets at the end of the month**

## Placing Orders through External Website
Sometimes orders will have to be placed outside these companies. Many sites will have a lab login (get from Katie), if there isn't one, you'll create one
**Make sure the account is tax-free; you can get the tax numbers from Katie to set this up**

To order from external companies:

1. Login with lab login
2. Place order, making sure no tax is applied (it\'s hard to get reimbursed)
3. If using your e-mail, and you receive receipt, rename PDF with same convention as above and add to Dropbox
4. Typically lab login will be through Katie's e-mail; confirm with Katie that she has received the receipt
