## **Protocol** {.unnumbered}

Wear gloves for all steps in this process. Do not touch door handles or computers with gloves on (unless the keyboard says "gloves only").

### **Before Starting** {.unnumbered}

-   Sample transfer: Samples will be in multiple boxes in freezer, but we only want to take a box out once to minimize sample degradation.
    - First, develop a sample transfer plan which lists which samples in a given box will be going into which places on the tray. Work with Dr. Lotterhos to develop the plan.
    - Take one box out of the freezer, transfer samples to its appropriate location on the ordered trays. <span style="color:red"> ADD A PHOTO OF THE ORDERED TRAY AND A SCREENSHOT OF THE DATA PLAN TO HELP NEW PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THIS STEP</span>

::: {.callout-note}
## Organizing trays according to data plan

Samples were randomized into different positions on different plates. There is a datasheet for this layout that was used to fill plates with corresponding samples. Pictures of the datasheet and organized samples are shown below. 

Data plan for sample organization

### **Tissue Lysing** {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-tip}
## Lab member roles during tissue lysis

This process goes smoothest with three lab members working at once. Two lab members should cut and weigh tissue samples, and read out weights to the third lab member who will record them in the spreadsheet or app and place samples into corresponding collection tubes. 
:::

1.  Prep surfaces and area around the scale. First clean with bleach solution, followed by <span style="color:purple"> DI </span> H2O <span style="color:red"> be specific - do you use ddH2O? we want to avoid people using tap water </span>, then 70% EtoH <span style="color:red"> be specific - which EtOH? </span>.

2.  Get a styrofoam container with ice to keep tissue samples cool while prepping for extraction. 

3.  Remove one plate of tissue from freezer and let thaw on counter (do not let them sit any longer than necessary). Once thawed they can be placed on ice (this generally won't cause them to re-freeze).

4. <span style="color:purple"> Get a tissue collection tube rack from Qiagen kit box. The clear tubes are already in a clear blue rack and have a clear lid over them. </span>

5. Add 18 mL buffer ATL to a 25 mL liquid boat (enough for 100 samples). Add 180uL buffer ATL to each tissue collection tube <span style="color:red"> DO YOU MEAN EACH WELL IN THE PLATE </span> using the P300 multichannel pipette. <span style="color:red"> WHY IS A COVER NEEDED HERE IF YOU ARE JUST ADDING BUFFER? </span> <span style="color:purple"> deleted note about the cover </span>

::: {.callout-tip}
## Tip for pipetting

_Drawing up liquid_. Check the amount on the pipette is correct. When pipetting, be sure only to push down on the plunger to the first stop and slowly release to pick up the liquid until your thumb comes completely off the plunger. If you go past the first stop, you will draw up more liquid than the amount you set on the pipette and/or create bubbles. If you push down and then release quickly to draw up liquid, it can cause aspiration and contaminate the pipette if you aren't using filtered tips. If you are using filtered tips, aspiration can cause liquid to land on the filter, so the pipette tip will hold less liquid than you specified. 

_Check the pipette tip has the correct amount_. Look at the pipette tip, or all the pipette tips if using the multichannel. Does it have the amount of liquid that you expect? Are there air bubbles (other than a tiny bubble that often forms at the very apex of the tip)? If so, push out the liquid and restart.

_Pushing out liquid_. Slowly push down on the plunger past the first stop until you reach the final stopping point for the plunger. Keep your thumb on the plunger until the tip of the pipette is completely removed from the solution. Drawing up your thumb before the tip is removed will suck up some of the solution. 

_Check the pipette tip is empty_. After you push the liquid out, check the pipette tip again and make sure it is empty. Dispose of the tip in a EHS-labeled waste jar. If there is any liquid in the tip that didn't get pushed out or beads of liquid on the inside of the tip, proceed to the next step.

_Solution is stuck in the pipette tip_. If there is any liquid in the tip that didn't get pushed out, carefully take the tip off. When you put the tip back on the pipette, some of the liquid may get pushed out, so carefully put the tip back on over the well where the solution needs to go. Then push down to the second stop and push the rest of the liquid out.

6.  Tare piece of weighing paper on scale.

<span style="color:red"> If this requires three people, can you explain the roles of the 3 people? </span> <span style="color:purple"> addressed in callout above </span>

7.  Carefully remove tissue from 2mL tube. Use a sterile scalpel <span style="color:red"> DO YOU MEAN SCALPEL? </span> blade to cut a piece of tissue roughly 20mg in weight (cut on weigh boat). Using 95% pure EtoH, gently rinse tissue in weigh boat and pat dry with clean kim wipe, so that the tissue appears nearly dry. <span style="color:red"> WHY IS A COVER NEEDED HERE IF YOU ARE JUST ADDING BUFFER? </span>

8.  Place tissue on weigh paper and measure the weight. If the tissue weighs 20mg+/-2mg place it in extraction tube. If not, either remove tissue as necessary or add more from sample tissue. Make sure the tissue is pushed all the way down into the solution at the bottom of the tube.

::: {.callout-important}
## Important: Prevent cross-contamination
Between samples, the scalpel & forceps should be sterilized by spraying <span style="color:red"> DO YOU SPRAY OR DIP IN ETOH? </span> <span style="color:purple"> spray </span> with EtoH and using a flame to burn off any residual EtoH and tissue. <span style="color:purple"> sterilize plastic sheet between samples by spraying with 70% EtOH and wiping with a Kim wipe. Make sure to carefully clean the hole punch where samples may contact. Remake plastic sheet between plates. </span>
:::


9.  Record weight in lab notebook <span style="color:purple"> or app </span> by well location, **not** by vial ID. Place sample into appropriate collection well plate (cyan plates). Keep plate covered with plastic sheet that has a hole in the center. This hole will expose one well at a time for tissue transfer. Sterilize plastic sheet between samples.

<span style="color:red"> can you add a photo of the plastic sheet? How do you sterilize it between samples? how do you prevent the hole from being contaminated? </span>

::: {.callout-important}
**Note:** Make sure tissue is all the way at the bottom of the well. 
:::

10. Add 2 mL Proteinase K to a 25 mL liquid boat (enough for 100 samples). Once all samples have been cut and placed in collection tubes, pipette 20 uL Proteinase K into each sample tube. 

11.  Seal wells with caps, then place clear cover over rack. Use vortexer to mix samples, then centrifuge for 20-30s at 4500 rpm, ensuring that a counter weight is placed into the centrifuge before starting. Add water to counter weight to account for differences in weight if necessary (Use practice extraction plate as counter weight.)

<span style="color:red"> what caps? can you add to list of materials? what do you mean by "clear cover over rack?" should we also specify to use the plate attachement for the vortexer? some photos here could help. Also, specify again the centrifuge in the Hughes lab because that always comes up. Where is the plastic extraction plate stored?  </span>

12.  Place samples on thermo-mixer set at 56 degrees at 600 rpm (we have plate attachment, but plates are too tall, so just put the sample plate on the mixer without the plate attachement). **BEFORE STARTING THE MIXER**: Make sure all tube caps are securely fastened. In addition, after 2 minutes on the thermo-mixer confirm the tube caps haven't popped open.

13.  Samples can be left for at least 2 hours or overnight to allow for all tissue to be completely lysed.

<span style="color:red"> can we be more specific about the lysing time that we will use for all the samples? </span>

<span style="color:red"> can we add instructions where data is entered in the App/Database - e.g. plate start/end time and lysing time </span>

### **Extraction** {.unnumbered}

<span style="color:red"> THROUGHOUT CAN YOU ADD INFO ON HOW EXTRA BUFFER IN WEIGH BOATS IS DISPOSED OF? </span>

1.  Prep surfaces and area around the work bench. First clean with bleach solution, followed by H2O <span style="color:red"> be specific - do you use ddH2O? we want to avoid people using tap water </span>, then 70% EtoH <span style="color:red"> be specific - which type of ETOH </span>.

2.  After removing samples from the thermomixer, ensure microtubes <span style="color:red"> DO YOU MEAN PLATE WELLS? </span> are properly sealed, cover racks <span style="color:red"> WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY COVER RACKS? </span> and shake vigorously for 15 seconds <span style="color:red"> DO YOU MEAN VORTEXT THEM?</span>. Centrifuge for 30s at 4500 rpm to collect any solution from the caps. Hold down short spin button.

3.  Carefully remove caps and add 410 μl Buffer AL using the 300μL multichannel pipette (split this into two rounds of pipetting 205μl of Buffer AL, only go to the first stop to avoid bubbles). For a full plate of 96 samples, use <span style="color:red"> the E-Pet pipette to transfer </span> 45 mL Buffer AL in a 50mL liquid boat. Tightly reseal with new caps.

4.  Place clear cover over the rack and shake vigorously for 15s <span style="color:red"> DO YOU MEAN VORTEXT THEM?</span>, then centrifuge 30s at 4500 rpm to collect any solution from the caps. <span style="color:red"> ARE WE STILL USING HUGHES CENTRIFUGE? </span>

**Note:** Ensure ethanol has been added to Buffer AL according to instructions on the container. <span style="color:red"> SHOULDN'T THIS COME BEFORE STEP 3? </span>

5.  Place DNeasy 96 plate on the S-Block, ensuring placement lines up correctly with the sample key.

6.  Carefully remove caps & transfer the lysate (up to 600μl) of each sample to the new wells using the 300μl multichannel pipette (set to 290μl). Pop any bubbles using a  pipette tip. <span style="color:red"> CAN WE BE MORE SPECIFIC? IS 600UL OF 290UL TRANSFERED? </span>

<span style="color:red"> HOW IS ADDITIONAL LYSATE DISPOSED? </span>

<span style="color:red"> I THINK MOST OF THESE STEPS CAN BE USED WITH UNFILTERED TIPS BECAUSE LIQUID IS JUST BEING TRANSFERED INTO THE SAMPLES, BUT I WONDER WITH STEP 6 ABOVE IF WE SHOULDN'T USE FILTERED TIPS BECAUSE TRANFERING THE SAMPLES COULD CAUSE CROSS-CONTAMINATION IF ASPIRATION OCCURS </span>

7.  Seal the plate with an AirPore tape sheet <span style="color:red"> ADD TO LIST OF MATERIALS NEEDED WITH ORDERING INFO </span> and centrifuge at 4500 rpm for 13 min.

8.  Remove tape and carefully add 500μl of Buffer AW1 to each sample. Use the 300μl multichannel pipette and add 250μl Buffer AW1 twice. This will require ~55mL of buffer AW1 in a liquid boat.

9.  Seal the plate with a new AirPore tape sheet and centrifuge at 4500 rpm for 7 min. 

10.  Remove tape and carefully add 500μl of Buffer AW2 to each sample. Use the 300μl multichannel pipette and add 250μl twice. This will require ~55mL of buffer AW2 in a liquid boat.

11. Seal the plate with a new AirPore tape sheet and centrifuge at 4500 rpm for 20 min. 

**Note:** Spin column membrane should be dry after this step. Spin for an additional 1 min if not.
<span style="color:red"> MOVE NOTES INTO CALLOUT BLOCKS? https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html </span>

12.  Transfer the DNeasy 96 plate on a rack of Elution Microtubes RS.

13.  Elute the DNA by adding 200μl of Low TE Buffer to each sample using the 300μl multichannel pipette. For a full plate, this will require ~20mL of low TE. Seal with a new AirPore tape sheet & incubate for 10 min at room temperature (15--25°C). Centrifuge for 3 min at 4500 rpm, and seal elution microtubes with new caps.

<span style="color:red"> ELUTION BUFFER DATA ADDED TO APP/DATABASE </span>

14.  Label plate and extracted DNA can be place in "No animals" fridge for a few days, or store at -20 or -80 for long term storage. **AVOID** numerous freeze-thaw cycles.

<span style="color:red"> INFORMATION ON SAMPLE STORAGE AND FREEZE/THAW SHOULD BE ADDED TO APP/DATABASE </span>


### **Cleaning the S-Blocks for reuse** {.unnumbered}

After each use, the S-Blocks must be sterilized for re-use.

<span style="color:red"> I'M WONDERING IF WE SHOULDN'T PUT THIS AT THE BEGINNING, E.G. IT SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE THE EXTRACTION STARTS. HOW ARE WE GOING TO KEEP TRACK IF IT'S BEEN STERILIZED OR NOT? E.G. IF A LONG TIME HAS GONE BY AND A NEW GROUP OF PEOPLE COMES IN, IT WOULD BE BEST TO RE-STERILIZE ANYWAY </span>


**Materials**

- 0.4M HCl solution
- Glass 6in x 6in x 8in container for bath
- ddH2O <span style="color:red"> add specifications, should be ordered not from MSC </span>
- fume hood
- container filled with ddH2O to submerge S-Block for rinsing

**Optional:** S-Blocks can be autoclaved after washing, and additional S-Blocks can be ordered from Qiagen

1. We often keep a pre-made HCl bath in the clear plastic <span style="color:red"> I THOUGHT I ORDERED GLASS? how is this container labeled? </span> container in the fume hood. A water bath is already made in the red plastic container <span style="color:red"> ?? can you be more specific?? </span>. If making a new bath, and **add the quantity of acid to the quantity of water** not the other way around. 

2. If a bath is not pre-made, prepare an 0.4M HCl bath. Calculate volume of HCl needed using C1V1 = C2V2 equation. Our HCl is 12M and located in the corrosives cabinet. For example, to get a total volume of 1.5L of 0.4M HCl, use the equation (12)(V1) = (0.4)(1.5) and use 50mL of 12M HCl <span style="color:red"> THIS SENTENCE WILL CONFUSE SOME READERS - recommend to specific how many mL of 12M HCl to add to ddH20, and where the H2O comes from -  I'm also confused why we need a full 1.5L to cover a small S-Block - can you double check </span>. 

3. If needed, prepare a container in the fume hood with enough water <span style="color:red"> be specfic, what kind of water? </span> to submerge the S-Block. 

4. Carefully submerge S-Block in 0.4M HCl bath for one minute. 

5. Transfer S-Block to the water container and submerge a few times to rinse

6. Leave S-Block on drying rack above sink. 

7. If making a new HCl bath, dispose of HCl and HCl-contaminated water in large hazardous waste bottle <span style="color:red"> THERE ARE MULTIPLE BOTTLES - make sure to dispose of in BOTTLE labeled ____ </span> under RNA hood (5L or 1 gal).
