I think taking 6308 + 6200 would be the best for new students, and if you had to pick one, 6308 is probably easier and will give students more bioinfo exposure. 
6200 is much harder, 
has much more comp sci theory/programming in it, and for someone who has never seen a fastq or bam file.. it might be a steeper learning curve.
