-   Make sure all the zippers are completely closed, with the zipper tucked under the fabric.

The kayak may be muddy or sandy when you are done. Do your best to keep it clean, but be very careful NOT to get sand inside the zippers or inside the valves. After you open the valves to deflate the kayak, *be sure to close them before you fold the kayak into the bag.* This will help keep sand out of the inside of the kayak.
