## **Extraction on *Spartinaalterniflora* with Qiagen DNAeasy Plant Mini Kit** {.unnumbered}

Following collection, fresh leaf tissue samples are stored in silica gel.

Tissue is homogenized using the TissueLyser II.

Following homogenization, 21 mg of leaf powder is used for each extraction.

Remainder of extraction follows procedure outlined in Plant Mini Kit handbook.

## **Tips for Pooled Sequences:** {.unnumbered}

Use an approximately equivalent weight of tissue from each sample. After homogenizing and prior to weighing out powdered tissue for extraction, samples can be combined and well mixed or an equal weight can be collected from each tube of powdered tissue.\
